<section><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>How happy are people today? Were people happier in the past? How satisfied with their lives are people in different societies? And how do our living conditions affect all of this?</p><p>These are difficult questions to answer; but they are questions that undoubtedly matter for each of us personally. Indeed, today, life satisfaction and happiness are central research areas in the social sciences, including in &#x2018;mainstream&#x2019; economics.</p><p>Social scientists often recommend that measures of subjective well-being should augment the usual measures of economic prosperity, such as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth" target="_blank">GDP per capita</a>.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> But how can happiness be measured? Are there reliable comparisons of happiness across time and space that can give us clues regarding what makes people declare themselves &#x2018;happy&#x2019;?</p><p>In this entry, we discuss the data and empirical evidence that might answer these questions. Our focus here will be on survey-based measures of self-reported happiness and life satisfaction. Here is a preview of what the data reveals.</p><ol><li>Surveys asking people about life satisfaction and happiness do measure subjective well-being with reasonable accuracy.</li><li>Life satisfaction and happiness vary widely both within and among countries. It only takes a glimpse at the data to see that people are distributed along a wide spectrum of happiness levels.</li><li>Richer people tend to say they are happier than poorer people; richer countries tend to have higher average happiness levels; and across time, most countries that have experienced sustained economic growth have seen increasing happiness levels.

The map here shows, country by country, the &#x2018;happiness scores&#x2019; published this report.</p><p>The underlying source of the happiness scores in the World Happiness Report is the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/services/170945/world-poll.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallup World Poll</a>&#x2014;a set of nationally representative surveys undertaken in more than 160 countries in over 140 languages. The main life evaluation question asked in the poll is: &#x201C;Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?&#x201D; (Also known as the &#x201C;Cantril Ladder&#x201D;.)</p><p>The map plots the average answer that survey-respondents provided to this question in different countries. As with the steps of the ladder, values in the map range from 0 to 10.</p><p>There are large differences across countries. According to 2016 figures, Nordic countries top the ranking: Finland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Iceland have the highest scores (all with averages above 7). In the same year, the lowest national scores correspond to Central African Republic, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and Haiti (all with average scores below 3.5).</p><p>You can click on any country on the map to plot time-series for specific countries.</p><p>As we can see, self-reported life satisfaction correlates with other measures of well-being&#x2014;richer and healthier countries tend to have higher average happiness scores.

For several countries, these surveys have been conducted at least annually for more than 40 years. The visualization here shows the share of people who report being &#x2018;very satisfied&#x2019; or &#x2018;fairly satisfied&#x2019; with their standards of living, according to this source.</p><p>Two points are worth emphasizing. First, estimates of life satisfaction often fluctuate around trends. In France, for example, we can see that the overall trend in the period 1974-2016 is positive; yet there is a pattern of ups and downs. And second, despite temporary fluctuations, decade-long trends have been generally positive for most European countries.</p><p>In most cases, the share of people who say they are &#x2018;very satisfied&#x2019; or &#x2018;fairly satisfied&#x2019; with their life has gone up over the full survey period.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Yet there are some clear exceptions, of which Greece is the most notable example. Add Greece to the chart and you can see that in 2007, around 67% of the Greeks said they were satisfied with their life; but five years later, after the financial crisis struck, the corresponding figure was down to 32.4%. Despite recent improvements, Greeks today are on average much less satisfied with their lives than before the financial crisis. No other European country in this dataset has gone through a comparable negative shock.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-people-who-say-they-are-happy-Eurobarometer" class="grapherPreview">

However, distributional differences are also important.</p><p>Life satisfaction is often reported on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 representing the highest possible level of satisfaction. This is the so-called &#x2018;Cantril Ladder&#x2019;. This visualization shows how responses are distributed across steps in this ladder. In each case, the height of bars is proportional to the fraction of answers at each score. Each differently-colored distribution refers to a world region; and for each region, we have overlaid the distribution for the entire world as a reference.</p><p>These plots show that in sub-Saharan Africa&#x2014;the region with the lowest average scores&#x2013;the distributions are consistently to the left of those in Europe. In economics lingo, we observe that the distribution of scores in European countries <em>stochastically dominates</em> the distribution in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>This means that the share of people who are &#x2018;happy&#x2019; is lower in sub-Saharan Africa than in Western Europe, independently of which score in the ladder we use as a threshold to define &#x2018;happy&#x2019;. Similar comparisons can be made by contrasting other regions with high average scores (e.g. North America, Australia and New Zealand) against those with low average scores (e.g. South Asia).</p><p>Another important point to notice is that the distribution of self-reported life satisfaction in Latin America is high across the board&#x2014;it is consistently to the right of other regions with roughly comparable income levels, such as Central and Eastern Europe.</p><p>This is part of a broader pattern: Latin American countries tend to have a higher subjective well-being than other countries with comparable levels of economic development.

The visualization shown demonstrates this for countries around the world, using data from Ipsos&#x2019; <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://perils.ipsos.com/" target="_blank">Perils of Perception</a>&#x2014;a cross-country survey asking people to guess what others in their country have answered to the happiness question in the World Value Survey.</p><p>The horizontal axis in this chart shows the actual share of people who said they are &#x2018;Very Happy&#x2019; or &#x2018;Rather Happy&#x2019; in the World Value Survey; the vertical axis shows the average <em>guess</em> of the same number (i.e. the average guess that respondents made of the share of people reporting to be &#x2018;Very Happy&#x2019; or &#x2018;Rather Happy&#x2019; in their country).</p><p>If respondents would have guessed the correct share, all observations would fall on the red 45-degree line. But as we can see, all countries are far below the 45-degree line. In other words, people in every country underestimated the self-reported happiness of others. The most extreme deviations are in Asia&#x2014;South Koreans think that 24% of people report being happy, when in reality 90% do.</p><p>The highest guesses in this sample (Canada and Norway) are 60%&#x2014;this is lower than the lowest actual value of self-reported happiness in any country in the sample (corresponding to Hungary at 69%).</p><p>Why do people get their guesses so wrong? It&#x2019;s not as simple as brushing aside these numbers by saying they reflect differences in &#x2018;actual&#x2019; vs. reported happiness.</p><p>One possible explanation is that people tend to misreport their own happiness, therefore the average guesses might be a correct indicator of true life satisfaction (and an incorrect indicator of <em>reported</em> life satisfaction). However, for this to be true, people would have to commonly misreport their own happiness while assuming that others do <em>not</em> misreport theirs.</p><p>And people are not bad at judging the well-being of other people who they know: There is substantial evidence showing that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/#can-happiness-really-be-measured">ratings of one&#x2019;s happiness made by friends correlate with one&#x2019;s happiness</a>, and that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/#how-much-does-language-matter-for-cross-country-comparisons-of-happiness">people are generally good at evaluating emotions from simply watching facial expressions</a>.</p><p>An alternative explanation is that this mismatch is grounded in the well-established fact that people tend to be positive about themselves, but negative about other people they don&#x2019;t know.It has been observed in other contexts that people can be optimistic about their own future, while at the same time being deeply pessimistic about the future of their nation or the world.

They note that two-thirds of the black-white happiness gap has been eroded (although today white Americans remain happier on average, even after controlling for differences in education and income), and the gender happiness gap has disappeared entirely (women used to be slightly happier than men, but they are becoming less happy, and today there is no statistical difference once we control for other characteristics).<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>The results from Stevenson and Wolfers are consistent with other studies looking at changes of happiness inequality (or life satisfaction inequality) over time. In particular, researchers have noted that there is a correlation between economic growth and reductions in happiness inequality&#x2014;even when <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/" target="_blank">income inequality</a> is increasing at the same time. The visualization here uses data from Clark, Fleche and Senik (2015)<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> shows this. It plots the evolution of happiness inequality within a selection of rich countries that experienced uninterrupted GDP growth.</p><p>In this chart, happiness inequality is measured by the dispersion &#x2014; specifically the standard deviation &#x2014; of answers in the World Value Survey. As we can see, there is a broad negative trend. In their paper the authors show that the trend is positive in countries with falling GDP.</p><p>Why could it be that happiness inequality falls with rising income inequality?</p><p>Clark, Fleche, and Senik argue that part of the reason is that the growth of national income allows for the greater provision of public goods, which in turn tighten the distribution of subjective well-being. This can still be consistent with growing income inequality, since public goods such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta/">better health</a> affect incomes and well-being differently.</p><p>Another possibility is that economic growth in rich countries has translated into a more diverse society in terms of cultural expressions (e.g. through the emergence of alternative lifestyles), which has allowed people to converge in happiness even if they diverge in incomes, tastes and consumption. Steven Quartz and Annette Asp explain this hypothesis in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/unequal-yet-happy.html?smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times article</a>, discussing evidence from experimental psychology.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/evolution-of-happiness-inequality-within-countries-during-periods-of-uninterrupted-economic-growth" class="grapherPreview">

We see that in all cases lines are upward sloping: people in higher income quintiles tend to have higher average life satisfaction. Yet in some countries the lines are steep and linear (e.g. in Costa Rica richer people are happier than poorer people across the whole income distribution); while in some countries the lines are less steep and non-linear (e.g. the richest group of people in the Dominican Republic is as happy as the second-richest group).</p><p>In a second visualization we present the same data, but instead of plotting each country separately, showing all countries in one grid.</p><p>The resulting connected scatter plot may be messy, resembling a &#x2018;spaghetti&#x2019; chart, but it is helpful to confirm the overall pattern: despite kinks here and there, lines are by and large upward sloping.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Happiness-by-Income-Quintiles-Small-Multiples.png" alt="Self-reported life-satisfaction across the income distribution" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Happiness-by-Income-Quintiles-Small-Multiples.png"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Happiness-across-income-distribution.png" alt="Self-reported life satisfactino across the income distribution, country by country" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Happiness-across-income-distribution.png"></figure></div></div><h3 id="looking-across-and-within-countries"><a class="deep-link" href="#looking-across-and-within-countries"></a>Looking across and within countries</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="a-snapshot-of-the-correlation-between-income-and-happiness-between-and-within-countries"><a class="deep-link" href="#a-snapshot-of-the-correlation-between-income-and-happiness-between-and-within-countries"></a>A snapshot of the correlation between income and happiness&#x2014;between and within countries</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Do income and happiness tend to go together? The visualization here shows that the answer to this question is yes, both within and across countries.</p><p>It may take a minute to wrap your head around this visualization, but once you do, you can see that it handily condenses the key information from the previous three charts into one.</p><p>To show the income-happiness correlation across countries, the chart plots the relationship between self-reported life satisfaction on the vertical axis and GDP per capita on the horizontal axis. Each country is an arrow on the grid, and the location of the arrow tells us the corresponding combination of average income and average happiness.</p><p>To show the income-happiness correlation <em>within</em> countries, each arrow has a slope corresponding to the correlation between household incomes and self-reported life satisfaction within that country. In other words: the slope of the arrow shows how strong the relationship between income and life satisfaction is within that country. (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/South-Africa-inequality-of-income-and-happiness-as-example.png">This chart</a> gives you a visual example of how the arrows were constructed for each country). <a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>If an arrow points northeast, that means richer people tend to report higher life satisfaction than poorer people in the same country. If an arrow is flat (i.e. points east), that means rich people are on average just as happy as poorer people in the same country.</p><p>As we can see, there is a very clear pattern: richer countries tend to be happier than poorer countries (observations are lined up around an upward-sloping trend), and richer people within countries tend to be happier than poorer people in the same countries (arrows are consistently pointing northeast).</p><p>It&#x2019;s important to note that the horizontal axis is measured in a logarithmic scale. The cross-country relationship we would observe in a linear scale would be different, since at high national income levels, slightly higher national incomes are associated with a smaller increase in average happiness than at low levels of national incomes. In other words, the cross-country relationship between income and happiness is not linear on income (it is &#x2018;log-linear&#x2019;). We use the logarithmic scale to highlight two key facts: (i) at no point in the global income distribution is the relationship flat; and (ii) a doubling of the average income is associated with roughly the same increase in the reported life-satisfaction, irrespective of the position in the global distribution.</p><p>These findings have been explored in more detail in a number of recent academic studies.

To be specific, this chart shows the share of people who say they are &#x2018;very happy&#x2019; or &#x2018;rather happy&#x2019; in the World Value Survey (vertical axis), against GDP per head (horizontal axis). Each country is drawn as a line joining first and last available observations across all survey waves.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>As we can see, countries that experience economic growth also tend to experience happiness growth across waves in the World Value Survey. And this is a correlation that holds after controlling for other factors that also change over time (in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Stevenson-Wolfers-2008-%E2%80%93-Happiness-and-Growth-744x550.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this chart</a> from Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) you can see how changes in GDP per capita compare to changes in life satisfaction after accounting for changes in demographic composition and other variables).</p><p>An important point to note here is that economic growth and happiness growth tend to go together <em>on average</em>. Some countries in some periods experience economic growth without increasing happiness. The experience of the US in recent decades is a case in point. These instances may seem paradoxical given the evidence&#x2014;we explore this question in the following section.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Inc-vs-Happiness-over-time.png" alt="People in richer countries tend to be happier and within all countries richer people tend to be happier" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Inc-vs-Happiness-over-time.png"></figure></div></div><h3 id="the-easterlin-paradox"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-easterlin-paradox"></a>The Easterlin Paradox</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The observation that economic growth does not always go together with increasing life satisfaction was first made by Richard Easterlin in the 1970s. Since then, there has been much discussion over what came to be known as the &#x2018;Easterlin Paradox&#x2019;.</p><p>At the heart of the paradox was the fact that richer countries tend to have higher self-reported happiness, yet in some countries for which repeated surveys were available over the course of the 1970s, happiness was not increasing with rising national incomes. This combination of empirical findings was paradoxical because the cross-country evidence (countries with higher incomes tended to have higher self-reported happiness) did not, in some cases, fit the evidence over time (countries seemed not to get happier as national incomes increased).</p><p>Notably, Easterlin and other researchers relied on data from the US and Japan to support this seemingly perplexing observation. If we look closely at the data underpinning the trends in these two countries, however, these cases are not in fact paradoxical.</p><p>Let us begin with the case of Japan. There, the earliest available data on self-reported life satisfaction came from the so-called &#x2018;Life in Nation surveys&#x2019;, which date back to 1958. At first glance, this source suggests that mean life satisfaction remained flat over a period of spectacular economic growth (see for example <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/mean-subjective-well-being-japan-1958-1987-easterlin-in-land-michalos-and-sirgy-ed-2011.png">this chart</a> from Easterlin and Angelescu 2011).<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> Digging a bit deeper, however, we find that things are more complex.</p><p>Stevenson and Wolfers (2008)<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> show that the life satisfaction questions in the &#x2018;Life in Nation surveys&#x2019; changed over time, making it difficult&#x2014;if not impossible&#x2014;to track changes in happiness over the full period. The visualization here splits the life satisfaction data from the surveys into sub-periods where the questions remained constant. As we can see, the data is not supportive of a paradox: the correlation between GDP and happiness growth in Japan is positive within comparable survey periods. The reason for the alleged paradox is in fact mismeasurement of how happiness changed over time.</p><p>In the US, the explanation is different, but can once again be traced to the underlying data. Specifically, if we look more closely at economic growth in the US over the recent decades, one fact looms large: growth has not benefitted the majority of people. Income inequality in the US is exceptionally high and has been on the rise in the last four decades, with incomes for the median household growing much more slowly than incomes for the top 10%. As a result, trends in aggregate life satisfaction should not be seen as paradoxical: the income and standard of living of the typical US citizen has not grown much in the last couple of decades.

In this visualization, we provide evidence of the relationship between health and subjective well-being within countries&#x2014;specifically; we focus here on mental health and self-reported life satisfaction.</p><p>Each bar in the visualization measures the extent to which mental illness (depression and anxiety) is associated with self-reported life satisfaction, once we control for physical illness and other factors such as income and education.

(2008)<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to identify groups of people experiencing significant life and labour market events, and trace how these events affect the evolution of their life satisfaction. The visualization here shows an overview of their main findings. In each individual chart, the red lines mark the estimated effect of a different event at a given point in time (with &#x2018;whiskers&#x2019; marking the range of confidence of each estimate).</p><p>In all cases the results are split by gender, and time is labeled so that 0 marks the point when the corresponding event took place (with negative and positive values denoting years before and after the event). All estimates control for individual characteristics, so the figures show the effect of the event after controlling for other factors (e.g. income, etc.).</p><p>The first point to note is that most events denote the evolution of a latent situation: People grow unhappy in the period building up to a divorce, while they grow happy in the period building up to a marriage.</p><p>The second point is that single life events do tend to affect happiness in the short run, but people often adapt to changes. Of course, there are clear differences in the extent to which people adapt. In the case of divorce, life satisfaction first drops, then goes up and stays high. For unemployment, there is a negative shock both in the short and long-run, notably among men. And for marriage, life satisfaction builds up before, and fades out after the wedding.</p><p>In general, the evidence suggests that adaptation is an important feature of well-being. Many common but important life events have a modest long-term impact on self-reported happiness. Yet adaptation to some events, such as long-term unemployment, is neither perfect nor immediate.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Life-events-on-happiness.png" alt="The effect of life events on life satisfaction" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Life-events-on-happiness.png"></figure></div></div><h3 id="does-disability-correlate-with-life-satisfaction"><a class="deep-link" href="#does-disability-correlate-with-life-satisfaction"></a>Does disability correlate with life satisfaction?</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>A number of papers have noted that long-term paraplegics do not report themselves as particularly unhappy, when compared to non-paraplegics (see for example the much-cited paper by Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman, 1978).<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>This assertion has received attention because it tells us something about the very meaning of well-being and has important consequences for policy.

Indeed, this is the most common approach.</p><p>In practice, social scientists tend to rely on questions inquiring directly about happiness, or on questions inquiring about life satisfaction. The former tend to measure the experiential or emotional aspects of well-being (e.g. &#x201C;I feel very happy&#x201D;), while the latter tend to measure the evaluative or cognitive aspects of well-being (e.g. &#x201C;I think I lead a very positive life&#x201D;).</p><p>Self-reports about happiness and life satisfaction are known to correlate with things that people typically associate with contentment, such as cheerfulness and smiling. (In <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/04/Life-Satisfaction-vs-Laugh-Gallup.png">this scatter plot</a> you can see that countries where people have higher self-reported life satisfaction are also countries where people tend to smile more).</p><p>Experimental psychologists have also shown that self reports of well-being from surveys turn out to correlate with activity in the parts of the brain associated with pleasure and satisfaction. And various surveys have confirmed that people who say they are happy also tend to sleep better and express positive emotions verbally more frequently.</p><p>The following table, adapted from Kahneman and Krueger (2006)<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a>, provides a list of the variables that researchers have found to be related to self-reported happiness and life satisfaction.</p><p>The main conclusion from the evidence is that survey-based measures of happiness and life satisfaction do provide a reasonably consistent and reliable picture of subjective well-being.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="tableContainer"><table id="tablepress-65" class="tablepress tablepress-id-65">

However, it is important to bear in mind that &#x201C;life satisfaction&#x201D; and &#x201C;happiness&#x201D; are not really synonyms. And this is of course reflected in the data, since self-reported measures of these two variables come from asking different kinds of questions.</p><p>The World Value Survey asks directly about happiness: <em>&#x201C;Taking all things together, would you say you are (i) Very happy, (ii) Rather happy, (iii) Not very happy, (iv) Not at all happy, (v) Don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The Gallup World Poll, on the other hand, uses the Cantril Ladder question and asks respondents to evaluate their life: <em>&#x201C;Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?&#x201D;</em></p><p>As the following scatter plot shows, these two measures are clearly closely related (countries that score high in one measure also tend to score high in the other), yet they are not identical (there is substantial dispersion, with many countries sharing the same score in one variable but diverging in the other).</p><p>The differences in responses to questions inquiring about life satisfaction and happiness are consistent with the idea that subjective well-being has two sides: an experiential or emotional side, and an evaluative or cognitive side. Of course, the limits between emotional and cognitive aspects of well-being are blurred in our minds; so in practice both kinds of questions measure both aspects to some degree. Indeed, social scientists often construct &#x2018;subjective well-being indexes&#x2019; where they simply average out results from various types of questions.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/Happiness-WVS-vs-Gallup" class="grapherPreview">

Indeed, cross-country comparisons of self-reported life satisfaction, such as those presented in &#x2018;happiness rankings&#x2019;, rely on national averages of reports on a scale from 0 to 10 (the Cantril Ladder).</p><p>Is it reasonable to take averages of life satisfaction scores? Or, in more technical terms: are self reports of Cantril scores really a cardinal measure of well-being?</p><p>The evidence tells us that survey-based reports on the Cantril Ladder do allow cardinal measurement reasonably well&#x2014;respondents have been found to translate verbal labels, such as &#x2018;very good&#x2019; and &#x2018;very bad&#x2019;, into roughly the same numerical values.<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a> <a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a></p><p>But as with any other aggregate indicator of social progress, averages need to be interpreted carefully, even if they make sense arithmetically. For example, if we look at happiness by age in a given country, we may see that older people do not appear to be happier than younger people. Yet this may be because the average-by-age figure from the snapshot confounds two factors: the age effect (people from the same cohort do get happier as they grow older, across all cohorts) and the cohort effect (across all ages, earlier generations are less happy than more recent generations). If the cohort effect is very strong, the snapshot can even give a picture that suggests people become <em>less</em> happy as they grow older, even though the exact opposite is actually true within all generations.</p><p>This example is in fact taken from the real world: using data from the US, Sutin et al. (2013)<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a> showed that self-reported feelings of well-being tend to increase with age across generations, but overall levels of well-being depend on when people were born.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-much-does-language-matter-for-cross-country-comparisons-of-happiness"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-much-does-language-matter-for-cross-country-comparisons-of-happiness"></a>How much does language matter for cross-country comparisons of happiness?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Linguistic differences are often seen as a major obstacle for making cross-country comparisons of happiness. However, there is evidence suggesting that comparability issues, at least in respect to language, are less problematic than many people think.</p><p>Studies have shown, for example, that in interviews in which respondents are shown pictures or videos of other individuals, respondents can broadly identify whether the individual shown to them was happy or sad; and this is also true when respondents were asked to predict the evaluations of individuals from other cultural communities. (For evidence of this see Sandvik et al., 1993; Diener and Lucas, 1999).<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a></p><p>Studies have also shown that &#x2018;indigenous emotions&#x2019; across cultures (i.e. feelings that are unique in that they do not have equivalents in the English language) are not experienced any more frequently or differently than common translated emotions. (See Scollon et al. 2005).<a id="ref-31" class="ref" href="#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a></p><p>The conclusion, therefore, seems to be that there is some basic understanding among humans about what it means to be &#x2018;happy&#x2019;. Survey-based measures of self-reported life satisfaction are informative about cross-country differences, even if these comparisons are obviously noisy.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>
