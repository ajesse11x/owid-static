As the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth">world&#x2019;s population</a> has expanded and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-real-gdp-per-capita-across-countries-and-regions?country=OWID_WRL">gotten richer</a>, the demand for all three has seen a rapid increase. Not only has demand for all three increased, but they are also strongly interlinked: food production requires <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-use-stress">water</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources">energy</a>; traditional energy production demands water resources; agriculture provides a potential energy source.&#xA0;</p><p>This article focuses on the environmental impacts of food. Ensuring everyone in the world has access to a nutritious diet in a sustainable way is one of the greatest challenges we face.

Indeed, energy, whether in the form of electricity, heat, transport or industrial processes, account for the majority &#x2013; 76% &#x2013; of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a> <br><br>But the global food system, which encompasses production, and post-farm process such as processing, and distribution is also a key contributor to emissions. And it&#x2019;s a problem for which we don&#x2019;t yet have viable technological solutions.<br><br>The visualization shown here &#x2013; based on data from the meta-analysis by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek (2018), published in <em>Science</em> &#x2013; summarizes food&#x2019;s share of total emissions and breaks it down by source.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a><br><br>Food is responsible for approximately 26% of global GHG emissions.</p><p>There are four key elements to consider when trying to quantify food GHG emissions. These are shown by category in the visualization:</p><p><strong>Livestock &amp; fisheries account for 31% of food emissions</strong>.&#xA0;<br>Livestock &#x2013; animals raised for meat, dairy, eggs and seafood production &#x2013; contribute to emissions in several ways. Ruminant livestock &#x2013; mainly cattle &#x2013; for example, produce methane through their digestive processes (in a process known as &#x2018;enteric fermentation&#x2019;). Manure management, pasture management, and fuel consumption from fishing vessels also fall into this category. This 31% of emissions relates to on-farm &#x2018;production&#x2019; emissions only: it does not include land use change or supply chain emissions from the production of crops for animal feed: these figures are included separately in the other categories.</p><p><strong>Crop production accounts for 27% of food emissions.</strong>&#xA0;<br>21% of food&#x2019;s emissions comes from crop production for direct human consumption, and 6% comes from the production of animal feed. They are the direct emissions which result from agricultural production &#x2013; this includes elements such as the release of nitrous oxide from the application of fertilizers and manure; methane emissions from rice production; and carbon dioxide from agricultural machinery.</p><p><strong>Land use accounts for 24% of food emissions.<br></strong>Twice as many emissions result from land use for livestock (16%) as for crops for human consumption (8%).<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a>Agricultural expansion results in the conversion of forests, grasslands and other carbon &#x2018;sinks&#x2019; into cropland or pasture resulting in carbon dioxide emissions. &#x2018;Land use&#x2019; here is the sum of land use change, savannah burning and organic soil cultivation (plowing and overturning of soils).&#xA0; </p><p><strong>Supply chains account for 18% of food emissions</strong>.<br>Food processing (converting produce from the farm into final products), transport, packaging and retail all require energy and resource inputs. Many assume that eating local is key to a low-carbon diet, however, transport emissions are often a very small percentage of food&#x2019;s total emissions &#x2013; only 6% globally. Whilst supply chain emissions may seem high, at 18%, it&#x2019;s essential for <em>reducing</em> emissions by preventing food waste. Food waste emissions are large: one-quarter of emissions (3.3 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq) from food production ends up as wastage either from supply chain losses or consumers. Durable packaging, refrigeration and food processing can all help to prevent food waste. For example, wastage of processed fruit and vegetables is ~14% lower than fresh, and 8% lower for seafood.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>Reducing emissions from food production will be one of our greatest challenges in the coming decades. Unlike many aspects of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources">energy production</a> where viable opportunities for upscaling low-carbon energy &#x2013;&#xA0; <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy">renewable</a> or nuclear energy &#x2013;&#xA0; are available, the ways in which we can decarbonize agriculture are less clear. We need inputs such as fertilizers to meet growing food demands, and we can&#x2019;t stop cattle from producing methane.

For most foods, this is <em>not</em> the case.</p><p>GHG emissions from transportation make up a very small amount of the emissions from food and what you eat is <em>far more</em> important than where your food traveled from.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="where-do-the-emissions-from-our-food-come-from"><a class="deep-link" href="#where-do-the-emissions-from-our-food-come-from"></a>Where do the emissions from our food come from?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>In the visualization we see GHG emissions from 29 different food products&#xA0;&#x2013; from beef at the top to nuts at the bottom.</p>



<p>For each product you can see from which stage in the supply chain its emissions originate. This extends from land use changes on the left, through to transport and packaging on the right.</p>



<p>This is data from the largest meta-analysis of global food systems to date, published in <em>Science </em>by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek (2018).</p>



<p> In this study, the authors looked at data across more than 38,000 commercial farms in 119 countries.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> </p>



<p>In this comparison we look at the total GHG emissions per kilogram of food product. CO<sub>2</sub> is the most important GHG, but not the only one &#x2013; agriculture is a large source of the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. To capture all GHG emissions from food production researchers therefore express them in kilograms of &#x2018;carbon dioxide equivalents&#x2019;. This metric takes account not just CO<sub>2</sub> but all greenhouse gases.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> In this comparison we look at the total GHG emissions per kilogram of food product.

This metric takes account not just CO<sub>2</sub> but all greenhouse gases.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>



<p>The most important insight from this study: there are massive differences in the GHG emissions of different foods: producing a kilogram of beef emits 60 kilograms of greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents). While peas emits just 1 kilogram per kg.</p>



<p>Overall, animal-based foods tend to have a higher footprint than plant-based. Lamb and cheese both emit more than 20 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents per kilogram. Poultry and pork have lower footprints but are still higher than most plant-based foods, at 6 and 7 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents, respectively.</p>



<p>For most foods &#x2013; and particularly the largest emitters &#x2013; most GHG emissions result from land use change (shown in green), and from processes at the farm stage (brown). Farm-stage emissions include processes such as the application of fertilizers &#x2013; both organic (&#x201C;manure management&#x201D;) and synthetic; and enteric fermentation (the production of methane in the stomachs of cattle). Combined, land use and farm-stage emissions account for more than 80% of the footprint for most foods.</p>



<p>Transport is a small contributor to emissions. For most food products, it accounts for less than 10%, and it&#x2019;s much smaller for the largest GHG emitters. In beef from beef herds, it&#x2019;s 0.5%.</p>



<p>Not just transport, but all processes in the supply chain after the food left the farm &#x2013; processing, transport, retail and packaging &#x2013; mostly account for a small share of emissions.</p>



<p>This data shows that this is the case when we look at <em>individual</em> food products. But studies also shows that this holds true for actual <em>diets</em>; <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#the-carbon-footprint-of-eu-diets-where-do-emissions-come-from">here</a></strong> we show the results of a study which looked at the footprint of diets across the EU. Food transport was responsible for only 6% of emissions, whilst dairy, meat and eggs accounted for 83%.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>You might think this figure is strongly dependent on where in the world you live, and how far your beef will have to travel. If you live somewhere very remote you&#x2019;d assume this must be much, much larger than if your beef is produced by your local farmer. But the key point here is that the difference in transport figures is very small relative to the total footprint of beef.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s take the example of beef from a beef herd &#x2013; the average footprint is approximately 60 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram of beef. Let&#x2019;s compare the transport footprint of buying from your local farmer (who turns out to be your neighbor), versus someone in the UK buying beef from Central America (approximately 9000 kilometers away).<br><br>Transporting food by boat emits 23 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per tonne of product per kilometer. To transport the 9000 kilometers from Central America to the UK therefore emits 0.207 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq [9000km * 23g per tonne-kilometer / 1000 / 1000 = 0.207 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kg]. This is equivalent to 0.35% of the total footprint of the 60 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram of beef.&#xA0;</p>



<p>If you buy from your local farmer &#x2013; let&#x2019;s assume you walk there, and have zero transport emissions &#x2013; your beef footprint is 59.8 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram [we calculate this as 60kg &#x2013; 0.2kg]. It makes almost no difference.</p>



<p>Especially for foods with a large footprint, transport as a share of the food&#x2019;s total emissions is fairly insensitive to the distance travelled. </p>

</div></div></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>In a study published in <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology, </em>Christopher Weber and Scott Matthews (2008) investigated the relative climate impact of food miles and food choices in households in the US.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> Their analysis showed that substituting less than one day per week&#x2019;s worth of calories from beef and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a plant-based alternative reduces GHG emissions more than buying <em>all</em> your food from local sources.</p><p>By analysing consumer expenditure data, the researchers estimated that the average American household&#x2019;s food emissions were around 8 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per year. Food transport accounted for only 5% of this (0.4 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq).<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a> This means that if we were to take the case where we assume a household sources <em>all</em> of their food locally, the maximum reduction in their footprint would be 5%. This is an extreme example because in reality there would still be small transport emissions involved in transporting food from producers in your area.</p><p>They estimated that if the average household substituted their calories from red meat and dairy to chicken, fish or eggs just one day per week they would save 0.3 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq. If they replaced it with plant-based alternatives they would save 0.46&#xA0;tCO<sub>2</sub>eq. In other words, going &#x2018;red meat and dairy-free&#x2019; (not totally meat-free) one day per week would achieve the same as having a diet with <em>zero</em> food miles.</p><p>There are also a number of cases where eating locally might in fact <em>increase</em> emissions. In most countries, many foods can only be grown and harvested at certain times of the year. But consumers want them year-round. This gives us three options: import goods from countries where they are in-season; use energy-intensive production methods (such as greenhouses) to produce them year-round; or use refrigeration and other preservation methods to store them for several months. There are many examples of studies which show that importing often has a lower footprint.</p><p>Hospido et al. (2009) estimate that importing Spanish lettuce to the UK during winter months results in three to eight times lower emissions than producing it locally.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a> The same applies for other foods: tomatoes produced in greenhouses in Sweden used 10 times as much energy as importing tomatoes from Southern Europe where they were in-season.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="avoid-the-small-share-of-foods-that-are-air-freighted"><a class="deep-link" href="#avoid-the-small-share-of-foods-that-are-air-freighted"></a>Avoid the small share of foods that are air-freighted</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The impact of transport is small for most products, but there is one exception: those which travel by air.</p><p>Many believe that air-freight is more common than it actually is. Very little food is air-freighted; <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-food-miles-by-method">it accounts for</a> only 0.16% of food miles.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a> But for the few products which are transported by air, the emissions can be very high: it emits 50 times more CO<sub>2</sub>eq than boat per tonne kilometer.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p>Many of the foods people assume to come by air are actually transported by boat &#x2013; avocados and almonds are prime examples. Shipping one kilogram of avocados from Mexico to the United Kingdom would generate 0.21kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq in transport emissions.<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a> This is only around 8% of avocados&#x2019; total footprint.<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a> Even when shipped at great distances, its emissions are much less than locally-produced animal products.</p><p>Which foods are air-freighted? How do we know which products to avoid?</p><p>They tend to be foods which are highly perishable. This means they need to be eaten soon after they&#x2019;ve been harvested. In this case, transport by boat is too slow, leaving air travel as the only feasible option.</p><p>Some fruit and vegetables tend to fall into this category. Asparagus, green beans and berries are common air-freighted goods.&#xA0;</p><p>It is often hard for consumers to identify foods that have travelled by air because they&#x2019;re rarely labeled as such. This makes them difficult to avoid. A general rule is to avoid foods that have a very short shelf-life <em>and</em> have traveled a long way (many labels have the country of &#x2018;origin&#x2019; which helps with this). This is especially true for foods where there is a strong emphasis on &#x2018;freshness&#x2019;: for these products, transport speed is a priority.</p><p>So, if you want to reduce the carbon footprint of your diet, avoid air-freighted foods where you can. But beyond this, you can have a larger difference by focusing on what you eat, rather than &#x2018;eating local&#x2019;. Eating less meat and dairy, or switching from ruminant meat to chicken, pork, or plant-based alternatives will reduce your footprint by much more.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="less-meat-is-nearly-always-better-for-your-carbon-footprint-than-sustainable-meat"><a class="deep-link" href="#less-meat-is-nearly-always-better-for-your-carbon-footprint-than-sustainable-meat"></a>Less meat is nearly always better for your carbon footprint than sustainable meat</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>What is the best way to reduce the carbon footprint of our diet?</p><p>I have <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">shown previously</a> that <em>what</em> we choose to eat has the largest impact, making a bigger difference than how far our food has traveled, or how much packaging it&#x2019;s wrapped in. This is because only a small fraction comes from transport and packaging and most of our food emissions come from processes on the farm, or from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">land use</a> change.</p><p>Regardless of whether you compare the footprint of foods in terms of their <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">weight</a> (e.g. one kilogram of cheese versus one kilogram of peas); <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-protein-poore">protein content</a> ; or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-kcal-poore">calories</a>, the overall conclusion is the same: plant-based foods tend to have a lower carbon footprint than meat and dairy. In many cases a much smaller footprint.</p><p>As an example: producing 100 grams of protein from peas <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-protein-poore">emits just</a> 0.4 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>eq).

Using global averages might give us a misleading picture for some parts of the world or some producers. If I source my beef or lamb from low-impact producers, could they have a lower footprint than plant-based alternatives?<br><br>The evidence suggests, no: plant-based foods emit fewer greenhouse gases than meat and dairy, regardless of how they are produced.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s take a look at the full range of footprints for protein-rich foods. </p><p>Protein-rich foods account for the bulk of our dietary emissions.

This can be seen at the bottom of our visualization. The red curve shows the sum of all protein products.&#xA0;</p><p>Most of the protein we produce is relatively low-impact: 75% of production has a footprint between -3 and 11 kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq per 100 grams of protein. This creates just 30% of protein&#x2019;s emissions.</p><p>High-impact production &#x2013; with a footprint greater than 11 kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq &#x2013; produces just 25% of our protein, but 70% of its emissions.&#xA0;To put this &#x2018;high-impact production&#x2019; in context: the top quarter of protein production emits more than five billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq each year. This is more than the EU&#x2019;s <em>total</em> annual <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a> from all sectors.<a id="ref-33" class="ref" href="#note-33"><sup>33</sup></a></p><p>Much of this skew, as we&#x2019;ve already discussed, comes from the differences between plant-based sources and meats such as beef and lamb. But a lot comes from the large variations in footprint for specific products.</p><p>There is much more variation in the footprints of beef, lamb, dairy, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/seafood-production#how-is-our-seafood-produced">aquaculture</a> production than for other foods. This is because there are large differences in the intensity and practices used in ruminant livestock, and fish farming across the world. This is different from poultry and pig farming: 61% of pork, 81% of chicken and 86% of eggs are produced intensively in industrial-farm settings.<a id="ref-34" class="ref" href="#note-34"><sup>34</sup></a> These systems are very similar wherever they are in the world.</p><p>One factor which explains a lot of the variation for beef is whether it&#x2019;s sourced from a dairy herd (where the cattle also produce milk) or a herd dedicated to beef production. Just under half (44%) of the world&#x2019;s beef comes from the dairy sector. And it produces 60% lower emissions because its footprint is shared with dairy co-products.</p><p>Geography also plays a role in the large variations we see for beef, lamb and aquaculture: farming approaches are often adopted in line with local conditions such as soil fertility, terrain and temperature.<a id="ref-35" class="ref" href="#note-35"><sup>35</sup></a> Opportunities for food producers to reduce emissions are therefore very specific to local conditions.</p><p>But there are some general recommendations that are clear from the research: improving degraded pasture; improving lifetime animal productivity; increasing oxygen flow in aquaculture ponds, particularly in warm climates; and avoiding the conversion of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/forests">forests</a> and peatlands for agriculture will all make a difference.<a id="ref-36" class="ref" href="#note-36"><sup>36</sup></a> Land use change can play a large role in the final emissions; this means beef from South America often has a high footprint due to deforestation. Good pasture quality is also important: climate has a strong impact on this, but effective management practices can also make a difference; New Zealand, France and the UK are some examples where footprints are often lower.</p><p>If we want to reduce the emissions from our food, there is massive scope for both consumers and producers. For producers, understanding and adopting best farm and land management practices can mitigate the highest impacts of production.</p><p>As consumers, the biggest difference we can make is to eat more plant-based sources of protein such as tofu, nuts, peas, and beans. This is the case regardless of where you are in the world.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="the-carbon-footprint-of-eu-diets-where-do-emissions-come-from"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-carbon-footprint-of-eu-diets-where-do-emissions-come-from"></a>The carbon footprint of EU diets: where do emissions come from?</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>We&#x2019;ve previously looked at the breakdown of carbon footprints for different food products. But our diets are made up of a wide range of foods &#x2013; do these findings hold true when we look at realistic diets?</p><p>Let&#x2019;s take a concrete example.</p><p>Vilma Sandstr&#xF6;m et al. (2018) compared greenhouse gas emissions from the average diet across countries in the European Union.<a id="ref-37" class="ref" href="#note-37"><sup>37</sup></a> In this study the researchers quantified the emissions from food production, land-use change and trade (i.e. transport) for each food group.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a></p><p>In the two visualizations here we see comparisons of the carbon footprint of the average EU diets: firstly the total emissions from each source in the supply chain and secondly, shown as the breakdown by <em>food item</em>.</p><p>The conclusions we can draw from this are the same.</p><p>We see that the majority of emissions result from land use change, or emissions at the farm level &#x2013; either methane emissions from cattle; management of manure; or use of fertilizer. Food transport accounted for only 6% of emissions.&#xA0;</p><p>When broken down by food items, dairy, meat and eggs dominate. They account for 83% of GHG emissions from the average EU diet. Only 17% results from plant-based foods. Most of the variation between countries comes from how much meat and dairy products they eat. </p><p><em>What </em>Europeans ate has the biggest impact on their footprint. We see this clearly in this visualization when we look at the footprint of the average European diet by source and by food type side-by-side.</p><p>Unless you&#x2019;ve cut it out completely, eating less meat and dairy products will have a much larger impact on your carbon footprint than eating locally. The climate benefits of eating locally are much smaller than people think.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-supply-chain-572x550.png" alt="Carbon footprint of eu diets by supply chain" class="wp-image-29660" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-supply-chain-572x550.png 572w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-supply-chain-400x385.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-supply-chain-150x144.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-supply-chain-768x738.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-supply-chain-1536x1477.png 1536w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-supply-chain-2048x1969.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-supply-chain.png"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-food-528x550.png" alt="Carbon footprint of eu diets by food" class="wp-image-29661" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-food-528x550.png 528w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-food-384x400.png 384w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-food-144x150.png 144w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-food-768x799.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-food-1476x1536.png 1476w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-food-1968x2048.png 1968w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-by-food.png"></figure><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-comparison-of-source-vs.-food-560x550.png" alt="Carbon footprint of eu diets comparison of source vs. food" class="wp-image-29662" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-comparison-of-source-vs.-food-560x550.png 560w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-comparison-of-source-vs.-food-400x393.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-comparison-of-source-vs.-food-150x147.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-comparison-of-source-vs.-food-768x755.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-comparison-of-source-vs.-food-1536x1509.png 1536w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-comparison-of-source-vs.-food-2048x2012.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Carbon-footprint-of-EU-diets-comparison-of-source-vs.-food.png"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="carbon-footprint-of-food-products"><a class="deep-link" href="#carbon-footprint-of-food-products"></a>Carbon footprint of food products</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>We have <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#you-want-to-reduce-the-carbon-footprint-of-your-food-focus-on-what-you-eat-not-whether-your-food-is-local">previously looked at</a> the comparisons in carbon footprint of food products based on mass: the greenhouse gas emissions from one kilogram of food product.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s also important to look at these comparisons in terms of nutritional units: this gives a measure of how low or high-impact different foods are in supplying protein or energy/calories, for example.</p><p>In the visualizations here we show the carbon footprint of foods as measured per 100 grams of protein, and per 1000 kilocalories.

<p>Let&#x2019;s take the example of asparagus.&#xA0;</p>



<p>If you live in the UK, you may have noticed on food labels that asparagus is often imported from Peru. They often come by plane. How does this affect their carbon footprint?<br><br>The average carbon footprint of asparagus is around 0.4 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram. Flying from Lima to London <a href="https://www.entfernungsrechner.net/en/distance/city/2643743/city/3936456">is around</a> 10,000 kilometers. If we were to fly one kilogram of asparagus over this distance, this would emit around 11 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq [10,000km * 1.13 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq per tonne-kilometer for flying / 1000 = 11.3 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kg]. Suddenly the footprint of your asparagus changes from being a low-carbon food to a relatively high-carbon one, at almost 12 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kg. It has a higher carbon footprint that a kilogram of chicken or pork.<br><br>It is the fact that it&#x2019;s flown, rather than the travel distance itself that gives asparagus a large footprint in this example. If it traveled the same distance by boat, the travel emissions would be only 0.26 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kg [10,000km * 0.026 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq per tonne-kilometer for transport by boat / 1000 = 0.26 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kg]. So its total footprint would be around 0.67 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kg, which still makes it a low-carbon food option.</p>

<p>Let’s take the example of beef from a beef herd. The average footprint of this beef is approximately 60 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram of beef. Let’s compare the transport footprint of buying from your local farmer (who lives just down the road from you), versus someone in the UK transporting beef from Central America (approximately 9000 kilometers away).</p>



<p>Transporting food by boat emits 0.023 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per tonne of product per kilometer. To transport the 9000 kilometers from Central America to the UK therefore emits 0.207 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq [9000km * 0.023kg per tonne-kilometer / 1000 = 0.207 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kg]. This is only equivalent to 0.35% of the total footprint of the 60 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram of beef.&nbsp;<br><br>If you buy from your local farmer – let’s assume you walk there, and have zero transport emissions – your beef footprint is 59.8 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram [we calculate this as 60kg &#8211; 0.2kg].

To make this accurate, the emissions of each country should be slightly lower than their reported values because we should remove the emissions from food waste for each.</p>



<p>This is a valid criticism. However, even if we were to remove food waste emissions from each country’s total, this ranking would remain the same. Food waste would not fall down the rankings since its 4th placed competitor – India – would see a slight <em>drop</em> in emissions. And it’s not possible that it would overtake the United States or China; the amount of emissions therefore allocated to food waste would be much smaller than the current gap.</p>



<p>If we accounted for this double-counting, the rankings would stay the same.</p></li><li id="note-48"><p>The food system and losses data in the study by Poore and Nemecek (2018) relates to the year 2010.
