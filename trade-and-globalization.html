<p>In this entry we analyze available data and research on international trade patterns, including the determinants and consequences of globalization over the last couple of decades. Here is an overview of the main points we cover below.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization#trade-has-changed-the-world-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Over the last two centuries trade has grown remarkably, completely transforming the global economy. Today about one fourth of total global production is exported. Understanding this transformative process is important because trade has generated gains, but it has also had important distributional consequences.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization#trade-from-a-historical-perspective" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">From a historical perspective, there have been two waves of globalization. The first wave started in the 19th century, and came to an end with the beginning of the First World War. The second wave started after the Second World War, and is still continuing.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization#trade-around-the-world-today" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Trade transactions include both goods (tangible products that are physically shipped) and services (intangible commodities, such as tourism and financial services). The production chains for these goods and services are becoming increasingly complex and global. According to recent estimates, about 30% of the value of global exports comes from foreign inputs.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization#explaining-trade-patterns-theory-and-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Most trade theories in the economics literature focus on sources of comparative advantage. These theories postulate that all nations can gain from trade if each specializes in producing what they are relatively more efficient at producing, based on their strengths. The empirical evidence shows that comparative advantage is indeed relevant; but it is not the only force driving incentives to specialization and trade.</a></li></ul>

The idea is that a country&#x2019;s geography is fixed, and mainly affects national income through trade. So if we observe that a country&#x2019;s distance from other countries is a powerful predictor of economic growth (after accounting for other characteristics), then the conclusion is drawn that it must be because <em>trade</em> has an effect on economic growth.

As we discuss in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-income-inequality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">companion blog post</a>, the efficiency gains from trade are not generally equally shared by everyone.

As a consequence, local markets respond, and prices change. This has an impact on households, both as consumers and as wage earners.</p><p>The implication is that trade has an impact on everyone. It&#x2019;s not the case that the effects are restricted to workers from industries in the trade sector; or to consumers who buy imported goods. The effect of trade extends to everyone because markets are interlinked, so imports and exports have knock-on effects on all prices in the economy, including those in non-traded sectors.</p><p>Economists usually distinguish between &#x201C;general equilibrium consumption effects&#x201D; (i.e. changes in consumption that arise from the fact that trade affects the prices of non-traded goods relative to traded goods) and &#x201C;general equilibrium income effects&#x201D; (i.e. changes in wages that arise from the fact that trade has an impact on the demand for specific types of workers, who could be employed in both the traded and non-traded sectors).</p><p>Considering all these complex interrelations, it&#x2019;s not surprising that economic theories predict that not everyone will benefit from international trade in the same way. The distribution of the gains from trade depends on what different groups of people consume, and which types of jobs they have, or could have.</p><p><em>(NB. You can read more about these economic concepts, and the related predictions from economic theory, in Chapter 18 of the textbook <a href="https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/18.html&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Economy: Economics for a Changing World</a>.)</em></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="the-link-between-trade-jobs-and-wages"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-link-between-trade-jobs-and-wages"></a>The link between trade, jobs and wages</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="evidence-from-chinese-imports-and-their-impact-on-factory-workers-in-the-us"><a class="deep-link" href="#evidence-from-chinese-imports-and-their-impact-on-factory-workers-in-the-us"></a>Evidence from Chinese imports and their impact on factory workers in the US</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The most famous study looking at this question is Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013): &#x201C;The China syndrome: Local labor market effects of import competition in the United States&#x201D;.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>In this paper, Autor and coauthors looked at how local labor markets changed in the parts of the country most exposed to Chinese competition, and they found that rising exposure increased unemployment, lowered labor force participation, and reduced wages. Additionally, they found that claims for unemployment and healthcare benefits also increased in more trade-exposed labor markets.</p><p>The visualization here is one of the key charts from their paper. It&#x2019;s a scatter plot of cross-regional exposure to rising imports, against changes in employment. Each dot is a small region (a &#x2018;commuting zone&#x2019; to be precise). The vertical position of the dots represents the percent change in manufacturing employment for working age population; and the horizontal position represents the predicted exposure to rising imports (exposure varies across regions depending on the local weight of different industries).</p><p>The trend line in this chart shows a negative relationship: more exposure goes together with less employment. There are large deviations from the trend (there are some low-exposure regions with big negative changes in employment); but the paper provides more sophisticated regressions and robustness checks, and finds that this relationship is statistically significant.</p><p>This result is important because it shows that the labor market adjustments were large. Many workers and communities were affected over a long period of time.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>But it&#x2019;s also important to keep in mind that Autor and colleagues are only giving us a partial perspective on the total effect of trade on employment. In particular, comparing changes in employment at the regional level misses the fact that firms operate in multiple regions and industries at the same time. Indeed, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.columbia.edu/~im2348/JMP_Magyari.pdf" target="_blank">Ildik&#xF3; Magyari recently found evidence</a> suggesting the Chinese trade shock provided incentives for US firms to diversify and reorganize production.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p> So companies that outsourced jobs to China often ended up closing some lines of business, but at the same time expanded other lines elsewhere in the US.

These are proportional gains, and are expressed as percent of initial household income.</p><p>As we can see, there is a net positive welfare effect across all income groups; but these improvements in welfare are regressive, in the sense that richer households gain proportionally more (about 7.5 percent gain compared to 5 percent).<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>Evidence from other countries confirms this is not an isolated case &#x2013; the expenditure channel really seems to be an important and understudied source of household welfare.

The visualization shows how, at the global level, costs across these three variables have been going down since 1930.</p><p>The reductions in transaction costs had an impact, not only on the volumes of trade, but also on the types of exchanges that were possible and profitable.</p><p>The first wave of globalization was characterized by inter-industry trade. This means that countries exported goods that were very different to what they imported &#x2013; England exchanged machines for Australian wool and Indian tea. As transaction costs went down, this changed. In the second wave of globalization we are seeing a rise in <em>intra</em>-industry trade (i.e. the exchange of broadly similar goods and services is becoming more and more common). France, for example, now both imports and exports machines to and from Germany.</p><p>The following visualization, from the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/477365-1327525347307/8392086-1327528510568/WDR09_12_Ch06web.pdf">UN World Development Report (2009)</a>, plots the fraction of total world trade that is accounted for by intra-industry trade, by type of goods. As we can see, intra-industry trade has been going up for primary, intermediate and final goods.</p><p>This pattern of trade is important because the scope for specialization increases if countries are able to exchange intermediate goods (e.g. auto parts) for related final goods (e.g. cars).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/real-transport-and-communication-costs" class="grapherPreview">

It is precisely this that distinguishes absolute advantage from comparative advantage.</p><p>To see the difference between comparative and absolute advantage, consider a commercial aviation pilot and a baker. Suppose the pilot is an excellent chef, and she can bake just as well, or even better than the baker. In this case, the pilot has an absolute advantage in both tasks. Yet the baker probably has a comparative advantage in baking, because the opportunity cost of baking is much higher for the pilot.</p><p>The freely available economics textbook <a href="https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/18.html&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Economy: Economics for a Changing World</a> explains this as follows: <em>&#x201C;A person or country has comparative advantage in the production of a particular good, if the cost of producing an additional unit of that good relative to the cost of producing another good is lower than another person or country&#x2019;s cost to produce the same two goods.&#x201D;</em></p><p>At the individual level, comparative advantage explains why you might want to delegate tasks to someone else, even if you can do those tasks better and faster than them. This may sound counterintuitive, but it is not: If you are good at many things, it means that investing time in one task has a high opportunity cost, because you are not doing the other amazing things you could be doing with your time and resources. So, at least from an efficiency point of view, you should specialize on what you are best at, and delegate the rest.</p><p>The same logic applies to countries. Broadly speaking, the principle of comparative advantage postulates that all nations can gain from trade if each specializes in producing what they are relatively more efficient at producing, and import the rest: &#x201C;do what you do best, import the rest&#x201D;.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p>In countries with relative abundance of certain factors of production, the theory of comparative advantage predicts that they will export goods that rely heavily in those factors: a country typically has a comparative advantage in those goods that use more intensively its abundant resources. Colombia exports bananas to Europe because it has comparatively abundant tropical weather. Under autarky, Colombia would find it cheap to produce bananas relative to e.g. apples.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="evidence-is-there-empirical-support-for-comparative-advantage-theories-of-trade"><a class="deep-link" href="#evidence-is-there-empirical-support-for-comparative-advantage-theories-of-trade"></a>Evidence: Is there empirical support for comparative-advantage theories of trade?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The empirical evidence suggests that the principle of comparative advantage does help explain trade patterns. Bernhofen and Brown (2004)<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a>, for instance, provide evidence using the experience of Japan. Specifically, they exploit Japan&#x2019;s dramatic nineteenth-century move from a state of near complete isolation to wide trade openness.</p><p>The graph here shows the price changes of the key tradable goods after the opening up to trade. It presents a scatter diagram of the net exports in 1869 graphed in relation to the change in prices from 1851&#x2013;53 to 1869. As we can see, this is consistent with the theory: after opening to trade, the relative prices of major exports such as silk increased (Japan exported what was cheap for them to produce and which was valuable abroad), while the relative price of imports such as sugar declined (they imported what was relatively more difficult for them to produce, but was cheap abroad).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Net exports and price changes for 1869, Japan &#x2013; Figure 4 in Bernhofen and Brown (2014)<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-750x487.png" alt="japan_bernhoffenbrown2014" class="wp-image-8677" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-750x487.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-150x97.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-400x260.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-768x499.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014.png"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="trade-diminishes-with-distance"><a class="deep-link" href="#trade-diminishes-with-distance"></a>Trade diminishes with distance</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The resistance that geography imposes on trade has long been studied in the empirical economics literature &#x2013; and the main conclusion is that trade intensity is strongly linked to geographic distance.</p><p>The visualization, from Eaton and Kortum (2002)<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a>, graphs &#x2018;normalized import shares&#x2019; against distance.

As we can see, there is a strong negative relationship. Trade diminishes with distance. Through econometric modeling, the paper shows that this relationship is not just a correlation driven by other factors: their findings suggest that distance imposes a significant barrier to trade.</p><p>The fact that trade diminishes with distance is also corroborated by data of trade intensity within countries. The visualization here shows, through a series of maps, the geographic distribution of French firms that export to France&#x2019;s neighboring countries. The colors reflect the percentage of firms which export to each specific country. As we can see, the share of firms exporting to each of the corresponding neighbors is largest close to the border. The authors also show in the paper that this pattern holds for the value of individual-firm exports &#x2013; trade value decreases with distance to the border.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Import share and distance between country pairs, OECD, 1990 &#x2013; Figure 1 in Eaton and Kortum (2002)<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-778x550.png" alt="eatonkortum2002_tradedistance" class="wp-image-21371" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-778x550.png 778w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-150x106.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-400x283.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-768x543.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography.png 1754w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography.png"></figure></div><h6>Percentage of firms which export in France, by importing country, 1992 &#x2013; Figure 2 in Crozet and Koenig (2010)<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-446x550.jpg" alt="france_trade_borders_2010" class="wp-image-8689" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-446x550.jpg 446w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-122x150.jpg 122w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-325x400.jpg 325w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-768x946.jpg 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010.jpg 1484w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010.jpg"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="institutions"><a class="deep-link" href="#institutions"></a>Institutions</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Conducting international trade requires both financial and non-financial institutions to support transactions.

The main manual providing guidelines for this approach is the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/50154/IMTS-Publication-List" target="_blank">International Merchandise Trade Statistics Manual</a> (IMTS).</li><li>The second approach relies on estimating trade from <em>macroeconomic data</em>, typically <em>National Accounts</em>. The main manual providing guidelines for this approach is the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2007/bopman6.htm" target="_blank">Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual</a> (BPM6), which was drafted in parallel with the 2008 <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/docs/sna2008.pdf" target="_blank">System of National Accounts of the United Nations</a> (SNA 2008). The idea behind this approach is recording changes in economic ownership.<a id="ref-39" class="ref" href="#note-39"><sup>39</sup></a></li></ul><p>Under these two approaches, it is common to distinguish between &#x2018;traded merchandise&#x2019; and &#x2018;traded goods&#x2019;. The distinction is often made because goods simply being transported through a country (i.e. goods in transit) are not considered to change the stock of material resources of a country, and are hence often excluded from the more narrow concept of &#x2018;merchandise trade&#x2019;.</p><p>Also, adding to the complexity, countries often rely on measurement protocols that are developed alongside these approaches and concepts that are not perfectly compatible to begin with. In Europe, for example, countries use the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/KS-02-17-333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#x2018;Compilers guide on European statistics on international trade in goods&#x2019;.</a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="measurement-error-and-other-inconsistencies"><a class="deep-link" href="#measurement-error-and-other-inconsistencies"></a>Measurement error and other inconsistencies</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Even when two sources rely on the same broad accounting approach, discrepancies arise because countries fail to adhere perfectly to the protocols.</p><p>In theory, for example, the exports of country A to country B should mirror the imports of country B from country A. But in practice this is rarely the case because of differences in valuation. According to the BPM6, imports and exports should be recorded in the balance of payments accounts on a &#x2018;<em>free on board</em> (FOB) basis&#x2019;, which means using prices that include all charges up to placing the goods on board a ship at the port of departure. Yet many countries stick to FOB values only for exports, and use CIF values for imports (CIF stands for &#x2018;Cost, Insurance and Freight&#x2019;, and includes the costs of transportation).<a id="ref-40" class="ref" href="#note-40"><sup>40</sup></a></p><p>The chart here gives you an idea of how large import-export asymmetries are. Shown are the differences between the value of goods that each country reports exporting to the US, and the value of goods that the US reports importing from the same countries. For example, for China, the figure in the chart corresponds to the &#x201C;Value of merchandise imports in the US from China&#x201D; minus &#x201C;Value of merchandise exports from China to the US&#x201D;.</p><p>The differences in the chart here, which are both positive and negative, suggest that there is more going on than differences in FOB vs CIF values. If all asymmetries were coming from CIF-FOB differences, then we should only see positive values in the chart (recall that, unlike FOB values, CIF values include the cost of transportation, so CIF values are larger).</p><p>What else is going on here?</p><p>Another common source of measurement error relates to the inconsistent attribution of trade partners. An example is failure to follow the guidelines on how to treat goods passing through intermediary countries for processing or merchanting purposes. As global production chains become more complex, countries find it increasingly difficult to unambiguously establish the origin and final destination of merchandise, even when rules are established in the manuals. <a id="ref-41" class="ref" href="#note-41"><sup>41</sup></a></p><p>And there are still more potential sources of discrepancies. For example differences in customs and tax regimes, and differences between &#x201C;general&#x201D; and &#x201C;special&#x201D; trade systems (i.e. differences between statistical territories and actual country borders, which do not often coincide because of things like &#x2018;custom free zones&#x2019;).<a id="ref-42" class="ref" href="#note-42"><sup>42</sup></a></p><p>Even when two sources have identical trade estimates, inconsistencies in published data can arise from differences in exchange rates. If a dataset reports cross-country trade data in US dollars, estimates will vary depending on the exchange rates used. Different exchange rates will lead to conflicting estimates, even if figures in local currency units are consistent.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/difference-in-the-value-of-goods-exported-to-and-imported-by-the-us" class="grapherPreview">

These include conceptual inconsistencies across measurement standards, as well as inconsistencies in the way countries apply agreed protocols. Here&#x2019;s a checklist of issues to keep in mind when comparing sources.</p><ul><li>Differences in underlying records: is trade measured from National Accounts data rather than directly from custom or tax records?</li><li>Differences in import and export valuations: are transactions valued at FOB or CIF prices?</li><li>Inconsistent attribution of trade partners: how is the origin and final destination of merchandise established?</li><li>Difference between &#x2018;goods&#x2019; and &#x2018;merchandise&#x2019;: how are re-importing, re-exporting, and intermediary merchanting transactions recorded?</li><li>Exchange rates: how are values converted from local currency units to the currency that allows international comparisons (most often the US-$)?</li><li>Differences between &#x2018;general&#x2019; and &#x2018;special&#x2019; trade system: how is trade recorded for custom-free zones?</li><li>Other issues: Time of recording, confidentiality policies, product classification, deliberate misinvoicing for illicit purposes.</li></ul><p>These factors have long been recognized by many organizations producing trade data. Indeed, international organizations often incorporate corrections, in an attempt to improve data quality along these lines.</p><p>The OECD&#x2019;s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=BIMTS_CPA" target="_blank">Balanced International Merchandise Trade Statistics</a>, for example, uses its own approach to correct and reconcile international merchandise trade statistics.<a id="ref-43" class="ref" href="#note-43"><sup>43</sup></a></p><p>The corrections applied in the OECD&#x2019;s &#x2018;balanced&#x2019; series make this the best source for cross-country comparisons. However, this dataset has low coverage across countries, and it only goes back to 2011. This is an important obstacle, since the complex adjustments introduced by the OECD imply we can&#x2019;t easily improve coverage by appending data from other sources. At Our World in Data we have chosen to rely on CEPII as the main source for exploring long-run changes in international trade; but we also rely on World Bank and OECD data for up-to-date cross-country comparisons.</p><p>There are two key lessons from all of this. The first lesson is that, for most users of trade data out there, there is no obvious way of choosing between sources. And the second lesson is that, because of statistical glitches, researchers and policymakers should always take analysis of trade data with a pinch of salt. For example, in a recent <a href="http://www.gfintegrity.org/report/illicit-financial-flows-from-developing-countries-2004-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-profile report</a>, researchers attributed mismatches in bilateral trade data to illicit financial flows through trade misinvoicing (or trade-based money laundering). As we show here, this interpretation of the data is not appropriate, since mismatches in the data can, and often do arise from measurement inconsistencies rather than malfeasance.<a id="ref-44" class="ref" href="#note-44"><sup>44</sup></a></p><p>Hopefully the discussion and checklist above can help researchers better interpret and choose between conflicting data sources.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

<p>Indeed, if you compare the chart showing the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/globalization-over-5-centuries-km" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global trade openness index</a> and the chart showing <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/merchandise-exports-gdp-cepii?country=OWID_WRL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global merchandise exports as share of GDP</a>, you find that the former is almost twice as large as the latter.</p>



<p>Why is the global openness index not exactly twice the value reported in the chart plotting global merchandise exports? There a three reasons.</p>



<p>First, the global openness index uses different sources. Second, the global openness index includes trade in goods and services, while merchandise exports include goods but not services. And third, the amount that country A reports exporting to country B does not usually match the amount that B reports importing from A.</p>

Secondly, data are adjusted for several specific large problems known to drive asymmetries. Presently these include “modular” adjustments for unallocated and confidential trade; for exports by Hong Kong, China; for Swiss non-monetary gold; and for clear-cut cases of product misclassifications. The list of modules is expected to grow over time. In the third step, adjusted data are balanced using a “Symmetry Index” that weights exports and imports. As the final step, the data are also converted to Classification of Products by Activity (CPA) products to better align with National Accounts statistics, such as in national Supply-Use tables.&#8221; You can read more about it here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.oecd.org/sdd/its/statistical-insights-merchandise-trade-statistics-without-asymmetries.htm" target="_blank">http://www.oecd.org/sdd/its/statistical-insights-merchandise-trade-statistics-without-asymmetries.htm</a>  In addition to the OECD, other sources also use corrections. The IMF&#8217;s DOTS dataset, for example, uses a 6 percent rule for converting import valuations (in CIF) into export values (in FOB).
