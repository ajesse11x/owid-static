But what is it? What does it tell us? Is it different from country to country? How does it change over time?</p><p>Here we try to answer these questions, providing an empirical overview of the gender pay gap across countries and over time.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-gender-pay-gap-measures-inequality-but-not-necessarily-discrimination"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-gender-pay-gap-measures-inequality-but-not-necessarily-discrimination"></a>The gender pay gap measures inequality but not necessarily discrimination</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The gender pay gap (or the gender wage gap) is a metric that tells us the difference in pay (or wages, or income) between women and men. It&#x2019;s a measure of inequality and captures a concept that is broader than the concept of equal pay for equal work.</p><p>Differences in pay between men and women capture differences along many possible dimensions, including worker education, experience and occupation. When the gender pay gap is calculated by comparing all male workers to all female workers &#x2013; irrespective of differences along these additional dimensions &#x2013; the result is the &#x2018;raw&#x2019; or &#x2018;unadjusted&#x2019; pay gap. On the contrary, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, etc., then the result is the &#x2018;adjusted&#x2019; pay gap.</p><p>Discrimination in hiring practices can exist in the absence of pay gaps &#x2013; for example, if women know they will be treated unfairly and hence choose not to participate in the labor market. Similarly, it is possible to observe large pay gaps in the absences of discrimination in hiring practices &#x2013; for example, if women get fair treatment but apply for lower-paid jobs.</p><p>The implication is that observing differences in pay between men and women is neither necessary nor sufficient to prove discrimination in the workplace. Both discrimination and inequality are important. But they are not one and the same. (You can read about discrimination and &#x2018;equal pay for equal work&#x2019; in our post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">here</a>).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="in-most-countries-there-is-a-substantial-gender-pay-gap"><a class="deep-link" href="#in-most-countries-there-is-a-substantial-gender-pay-gap"></a>In most countries there is a substantial gender pay gap</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Cross-country data on the gender pay gap is patchy, but the most complete source in terms of coverage is the United Nation&#x2019;s <em>International Labour Organization</em> (ILO).

To answer this question, let&#x2019;s consider this chart showing available estimates from the OECD. These estimates include OECD member states, as well as some other non-member countries, and they are the longest available series of cross-country data on the gender pay gap that we are aware of.</p><p>Here we see that the gap is large in most OECD countries, but it has been going down in the last couple of decades. In some cases the reduction is remarkable. In the UK, for example, the gap went down from almost 50% in 1970 to about 17% in 2016.</p><p>These estimates are not directly comparable to those from the ILO, because the pay gap is measured slightly differently here: The OECD estimates refer to percent differences in <em>median</em> earnings (i.e. the gap here captures differences between men and women in the middle of the earnings distribution); and they cover only full-time employees and self-employed workers (i.e. the gap here excludes disparities that arise from differences in hourly wages for part-time and full-time workers).</p><p>However, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-2000-vs-2015"> ILO data shows similar trends for the period 2000-2015.</a></p><p>The conclusion is that in most countries with available data, the gender pay gap has decreased in the last couple of decades.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-oecd?country=AUS+FRA+ITA+JPN+SWE+GBR+USA" class="grapherPreview">

Here, values below 100% mean that women earn less than men, while values above 100% mean than women earn more.

Secondly, we see that there are important differences by age.</p><p>The second point is crucial to understand the gender pay gap: the gap is a statistic that changes during the life of a worker.

As we can see there is a weak positive correlation between GDP per capita and the gender pay gap. However, the chart shows that the relationship is not really linear. Actually, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-banks-income-groups?year=2016" target="_blank">middle-income countries</a> tend to have the smallest pay gap.</p><p>The fact that middle-income countries have low gender wage gaps is, to a large extent, the result of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-rates-by-national-per-capita-income" target="_blank">selection of women into employment</a>. Olivetti and Petrongolo (2008) explain it as follows: &#x201C;if women who are employed tend to have relatively high&#x2010;wage characteristics, low female employment rates may become consistent with low gender wage gaps simply because low&#x2010;wage women would not feature in the observed wage distribution.&#x201D;<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p><p>Olivetti and Petrongolo (2008) show that this pattern holds in the data: unadjusted gender wage gaps across countries tend to be negatively correlated with gender employment gaps. That is, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-hourly-wages-vs-ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation">the gender pay gaps tend to be smaller where relatively fewer women participate in the labor force</a>.</p><p>So, rather than reflect greater equality, the lower wage gaps observed in some countries could indicate that only women with certain characteristics &#x2013; for instance, with no husband or children &#x2013; are entering the workforce.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview">

Do we find any evidence of the so-called &#x2018;glass ceiling&#x2019; preventing women from reaching the top? How did this change over time?</p><p>Answers to these questions are found in the work of Atkinson, Casarico and Voitchovsky (2018). Using tax records, they investigated the incomes of women and men separately across nine high-income countries. As such, they were restricted to those countries in which taxes are collected on individual basis, rather than as couples.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>In addition to wages they also take into account income from investments and self-employment.</p><p>Whilst investment income tends to make up a larger share of the total income of rich individuals in general, the authors found this to be particularly marked in the case of women in top income groups.</p><p>The two charts present the key figures from the study.</p><p>One chart shows the proportion of women out of all individuals falling into the top 10%, 1% and 0.1% of the income distribution. The open circle represents the share of women in the top income brackets back in 2000; the closed circle shows the latest data, which is from 2013.</p><p>The other chart shows the data over time for individual countries. You can explore data for other countries using the &#x2018;Change Country&#x2019; button in the bottom-left of the chart.</p><p><strong>The two charts allow us to answer the initial questions:</strong></p><ul><li>Women are greatly under-represented in top income groups &#x2013; they make up much less than 50% across each of the nine countries. Within the top 1% women account for around 20% and there is surprisingly little variation across countries.</li><li>The proportion of women is lower the higher you look up the income distribution. In the top 10% up to every third income-earner is a woman; in the top 0.1% only every fifth or tenth person is a woman.</li><li>The trend is the same in all countries of this study: Women are now better-represented in all top income groups than they were in 2000.</li><li>But improvements have generally been more limited at the <span data-token-index="1" data-reactroot>very</span> top. With the exception of Australia, we see a much smaller increase in the share of women amongst the top 0.1% than amongst the top 10%.</li></ul><p>Overall, despite recent inroads, we continue to see remarkably few women making it to the top of the income distribution today.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Share of women in top income groups, 2000 vs 2013<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Change-2000-to-2013-hq-573x550.png" alt="Change 2000 to 2013 hq" class="wp-image-23210" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Change-2000-to-2013-hq-573x550.png 573w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Change-2000-to-2013-hq-150x144.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Change-2000-to-2013-hq-400x384.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Change-2000-to-2013-hq-768x737.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Change-2000-to-2013-hq.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-women-in-top-income-groups-atkinson-casarico-voitchovsky-2018" class="grapherPreview">

In the chart we show that this correlation also holds within countries: Women&#x2019;s control is greater in wealthier households.

In particular, over the last couple of decades <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-oecd?country=AUS+FRA+ITA+JPN+SWE+GBR+USA">most high-income countries have seen sizeable reductions in the gender pay gap</a>.</p><p>How did these reductions come about and why do substantial gaps remain?</p><p>Before we get into the details, here is a preview of the main points.</p><ul><li>An important part of the reduction in the gender pay gap in rich countries over the last decades is due to a historical narrowing, and often even reversal of the <em>education</em> gap between men and women.</li><li>Today, education is relatively unimportant to explain the remaining gender pay gap in rich countries. In contrast, the <em>characteristics of the jobs</em> that women tend to do, remain important contributing factors.</li><li>The gender pay gap is not a direct metric of discrimination. However, evidence from different contexts suggests <em>discrimination</em> is indeed important to understand the gender pay gap. Similarly, <em>social norms</em> affecting the gender distribution of labor are important determinants of wage inequality.</li><li>On the other hand, the available evidence suggests differences in psychological attributes and non-cognitive skills are at best modest factors contributing to the gender pay gap.</li></ul></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="differences-in-human-capital"><a class="deep-link" href="#differences-in-human-capital"></a>Differences in human capital</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-adjusted-pay-gap"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-adjusted-pay-gap"></a><strong> The adjusted pay gap</strong></h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Differences in earnings between men and women capture differences across many possible dimensions, including education, experience and occupation.</p><p>For example, if we consider that more educated people tend to have higher earnings, it is natural to expect that the narrowing of the pay gap across the world can be partly explained by the fact that women have been <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-ratios-for-mean-years-of-schooling">catching up</a> with men in terms of educational attainment, in particular years of schooling.</p><p>Indeed, since differences in education partly contribute to explain differences in wages, it is common to distinguish between &#x2018;unadjusted&#x2019; and &#x2018;adjusted&#x2019; pay differences.</p><p>When the gender pay gap is calculated by comparing all male and female workers, irrespective of differences in worker characteristics, the result is the raw or <em>unadjusted</em> pay gap. In contrast to this, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, and other factors that matter for the pay gap, then the result is the <em>adjusted</em> pay gap.</p><p>The idea of the adjusted pay gap is to make comparisons within groups of workers with roughly similar jobs, tenure and education. This allows us to tease out the extent to which different factors contribute to observed inequalities.</p><p>The chart here, from Blau and Kahn (2017) shows the evolution of the adjusted and unadjusted gender pay gap in the US.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>More precisely, the chart shows the evolution of female to male wage ratios in three different scenarios: (i) Unadjusted; (ii) Adjusted, controlling for gender differences in human capital, i.e. education and experience; and (iii) Adjusted, controlling for a full range of covariates, including education, experience, job industry and occupation, among others.

This third point follows from the fact that the difference between the blue and red bars was much larger in 1980 than in 2010.</li><li>And fourth, the green bars grew substantially in the 1980s, but stayed fairly constant thereafter. In other words: Most of the convergence in earnings occurred during the 1980s, a decade in which the &#x201C;unexplained&#x201D; gap shrunk substantially.</li></ul></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-739x550.png" alt="Female to male wage ratio 01" class="wp-image-16606" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-739x550.png 739w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-150x112.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-400x298.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-768x572.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="education-and-experience-have-become-much-less-important-in-explaining-gender-differences-in-wages-in-the-us"><a class="deep-link" href="#education-and-experience-have-become-much-less-important-in-explaining-gender-differences-in-wages-in-the-us"></a>Education and experience have become much less important in explaining gender differences in wages in the US</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The chart here shows a breakdown of the adjusted gender pay gaps in the US, factor by factor, in 1980 and 2010.</p><p>When comparing the contributing factors in 1980 and 2010, we see that education and work experience have become much less important in explaining gender differences in wages over time, while occupation and industry have become more important.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>In this chart we can also see that the &#x2018;unexplained&#x2019; residual has gone down.

At first sight, this seems like good news &#x2013; it suggests that today there is less discrimination, in the sense that differences in earnings are today much more readily explained by differences in &#x2018;productivity&#x2019; factors. But is this really the case?</p><p>The unexplained residual may include aspects of unmeasured productivity (i.e. unobservable worker characteristics that cannot be controlled for in a regression), while the &#x201C;explained&#x201D; factors may themselves be vehicles of discrimination.</p><p>For example, suppose that women are indeed discriminated against, and they find it hard to get hired for certain jobs simply because of their sex.

In other words, women, more than men, are expected to have temporal flexibility in their jobs. Things like shifting hours of work and rearranging shifts to accommodate emergencies at home. And these are jobs with lower earnings per hour, even when the total number of hours worked is the same.</p><p>The importance of job flexibility in this context is very clearly illustrated by the fact that, over the last couple of decades, women in the US increased their participation and remuneration in only some fields. In a recent paper, Goldin and Katz (2016) show that pharmacy became a highly remunerated female-majority profession with a small gender earnings gap in the US, at the same time as pharmacies went through substantial technological changes that made flexible jobs in the field more productive (e.g. computer systems that increased the substitutability among pharmacists).<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>The chart here shows how quickly female wages increased in pharmacy, relative to other professions, over the last few decades in the US.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Female median earnings of full-time, year-round pharmacists relative to other professions, 1970-2010, US &#x2013; Goldin and Katz (2016)<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-750x464.png" alt="Goldin female pharmacy pay" class="wp-image-16163" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-750x464.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-150x93.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-400x248.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-768x475.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay.png 866w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-motherhood-penalty"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-motherhood-penalty"></a><strong>The motherhood penalty</strong></h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Closely related to job flexibility and occupational choice, is the issue of work interruptions due to motherhood. On this front there is again a great deal of evidence in support of the so-called &#x2018;motherhood penalty&#x2019;.</p><p>Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen (2017) provide evidence from Denmark &#x2013; more specifically, Danish women who sought medical help in achieving pregnancy.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> </p><p>By tracking women&#x2019;s fertility and employment status through detailed periodic surveys, these researchers were able to establish that women who had a successful <em>in vitro fertilization</em> treatment, ended up having lower earnings down the line than similar women who, by chance, were unsuccessfully treated.</p><p>Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen summarise their findings as follows: &#x201C;Our main finding is that women who are successfully treated by [in vitro fertilization] earn persistently less because of having children. We explain the decline in annual earnings by women working less when children are young and getting paid less when children are older. We explain the decline in hourly earnings, which is often referred to as the motherhood penalty, by women moving to lower-paid jobs that are closer to home.&#x201D;</p><p>The fact that the motherhood penalty is indeed about &#x2018;motherhood&#x2019; and not &#x2018;parenthood&#x2019;, is supported by further evidence.</p><p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24219#fromrss">A recent study</a>, also from Denmark, tracked men and women over the period 1980-2013, and found that after the first child, women&#x2019;s earnings sharply dropped and never fully recovered. But this was not the case for men with children, nor the case for women without children.</p><p>These patterns are shown in the chart here.

This leads to obvious questions: What determines the systematic gender differences in occupational choice? What makes women seek job flexibility and take a disproportionate amount of unpaid care work?</p><p>One argument usually put forward is that, to the extent that biological differences in preferences and abilities underpin gender roles, they are the main factors explaining the gender pay gap. In their review of the evidence, Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn (2017) show that there is limited empirical support for this argument.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p>To be clear, yes, there is evidence supporting the fact that men and women differ in some key attributes that may affect labor market outcomes. For example standardised tests show that there are <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> statistical gender gaps in maths scores&#xA0;in some countries</a>; and experiments show that women <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid more salary negotiations</a>, and they often <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show particular predisposition to accept and receive requests for tasks with low promotion potential</a>. However, these observed differences are far from being biologically fixed &#x2013; &#x2018;gendering&#x2019; begins early in life and the evidence shows that preferences and skills are highly malleable. You can influence tastes, and you can certainly teach people to tolerate risk, to do maths, or to negotiate salaries.</p><p>What&#x2019;s more, independently of where they come from, Blau and Kahn show that these empirically observed differences can typically only account for a modest portion of the gender pay gap.</p><p>In contrast, the evidence does suggest that social norms and culture, which in turn affect preferences, behaviour and incentives to foster specific skills, are key factors in understanding gender differences in labor force participation and wages.

Goldin (1988), for instance, examines past prohibitions against the training and employment of married women in the US. She touches on some well-known restrictions, such as those against the training and employment of women as doctors and lawyers, before focusing on the lesser known but even more impactful <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_bar" target="_blank">&#x2018;marriage bars&#x2019;</a> which arose in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&#xA0;These work prohibitions are important because they applied to teaching and clerical jobs &#x2013; occupations that would become the most commonly held among married women after 1950. Around the time the US entered World War II, it is estimated that 87% of all school boards would not hire a married woman and 70% would not retain an unmarried woman who married.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>The map here highlights that to this day, explicit barriers across the world limit the extent to which women are allowed to do the same jobs as men.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>However, even after explicit barriers are lifted and legal protections put in their place, discrimination and bias can persist in less overt ways. Goldin and Rouse (2000), for example, look at the adoption of &#x201C;blind&#x201D; auditions by orchestras, and show that by using a screen to conceal the identity of a candidate, impartial hiring practices increased the number of women in orchestras by 25% between 1970 and 1996.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></p><p>Many other studies have found similar evidence of bias in different labor market contexts. Biases also operate in other spheres of life with strong knock-on effects on labor market outcomes. For example, at the end of World War II <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/what-percentage-of-the-us-public-approves-of-working-wives">only 18% of people in the US thought that a wife should work if her husband was able to support her</a>. This obviously circles back to our earlier point about social norms.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/can-non-pregnant-and-non-nursing-women-do-the-same-jobs-as-men" class="grapherPreview">

However, in many countries gender gaps in education have been closed and we still have large gender inequalities in the workforce. What else can be done?</p><p>An obvious alternative is fighting discrimination. But the evidence presented above shows that this is not enough. Public policy and management changes on the firm level matter too: Family-friendly labor-market policies may help. For example, maternity leave coverage can contribute by raising women&#x2019;s retention over the period of childbirth, which in turn raises women&#x2019;s wages through the maintenance of work experience and job tenure.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><p>Similarly, early education and childcare can increase the labor force participation of women &#x2014; and reduce gender pay gaps&#xA0;&#x2014; by alleviating the unpaid care work undertaken by mothers.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></p><p>Additionally, the experience of women&#x2019;s historical advance in specific professions (e.g. pharmacists in the US), suggests that the gender pay gap could also be considerably reduced&#xA0;if firms did not have the incentive to disproportionately reward workers who work long hours, and fixed, non-flexible schedules.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a></p><p>Changing these incentives is of course difficult because it requires reorganizing the workplace. But it is likely to have a large impact on gender inequality, particularly in countries where other measures are already in place.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p>Implementing these strategies can have a positive self-reinforcing effect. For example, family-friendly labor-market policies that lead to higher labor-force attachment and salaries for women, will raise the returns to women&#x2019;s investment in education &#x2013; so women in future generations will be more likely to invest in education, which will also help narrow gender gaps in labor market outcomes down the line.<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p><p>Nevertheless, powerful as these strategies may be, they are only part of the solution. Social norms and culture remain at the heart of family choices and the gender distribution of labor. Achieving equality in opportunities requires ensuring that we change the norms and stereotypes that limit the set of choices available both to men and women. It is difficult, but <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the evidence</a> shows that social norms, too, can be changed.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

It&#x2019;s a measure of inequality and captures a concept that is broader than the concept of equal pay for equal work.</p><p>Differences in pay between men and women capture differences along many possible dimensions, including worker education, experience and occupation. When the gender pay gap is calculated by comparing all male workers to all female workers &#x2013; irrespective of differences along these additional dimensions &#x2013; the result is the &#x2018;raw&#x2019; or <strong>unadjusted pay gap</strong>. On the contrary, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, etc., then the result is the<strong> adjusted pay gap</strong>.</p><p>Discrimination in hiring practices can exist in the absence of pay gaps &#x2013; for example, if women know they will be treated unfairly and hence choose not to participate in the labor market. Similarly, it is possible to observe large pay gaps in the absences of discrimination in hiring practices &#x2013; for example, if women get fair treatment but apply for lower-paid jobs.</p><p>The implication is that observing differences in pay between men and women is neither necessary nor sufficient to prove discrimination in the workplace. Both discrimination and inequality are important.
