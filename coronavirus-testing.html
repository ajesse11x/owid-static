<p>This chart shows the number of&#xA0;<em>daily</em>&#xA0;tests per thousand people. Because the number of tests is often volatile from day to day, we show the figures as a three-day rolling average. </p>



<h5>What is counted as a test?</h5>



<p>The number of tests does not refer to the same in each country &#x2013; one difference is that some countries report the number of people tested, while others report the number of tests (which can be higher if the same person is tested more than once). And other countries report their testing data in a way that leaves it unclear what the test count refers to exactly.</p>



<p>We indicate the differences in the chart and explain them in detail in our accompanying&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#source-information-country-by-country" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source descriptions</a>.</p>

<p>This chart brings our data on testing together with the data on confirmed cases.</p>



<p>The chart answers the question:&#xA0;<strong>How many tests did a country do to find one COVID-19 case?</strong></p>



<p>&#x2022; Some countries &#x2013; for example Taiwan and Vietnam &#x2013; did a large number of tests per each confirmed case.</p>



<p>&#x2022; For others the ratio is more than two orders of magnitude lower. These countries found a case for every few tests they did.</p>

The dotted comparison lines show the points on the chart where the number of tests are a fixed number of times larger than the number of confirmed cases &#x2013; 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 times larger.</p><p>In terms of testing coverage the UK appears to be ahead of Taiwan, with at least twice the number of people tested per thousand, as of 11 April.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>But on the same date, there were <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-confirmed-cases-of-covid-19-per-million-people?tab=chart&amp;country=TWN+GBR">60 times</a> more confirmed cases per million in the UK than in Taiwan &#x2013; 1,035 per million and 16 cases per million respectively.&#xA0;</p><p>So whilst testing relative to population size is higher in the UK, testing <em>relative to the</em> <em>size of the outbreak</em> is much, much higher in Taiwan.</p><p>As of 11 April, in Taiwan one case was confirmed for every 120 tests. In the UK, a case was confirmed in fewer than every four tests.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>In Australia, testing coverage is much higher than in Taiwan. But in terms of the number of tests per confirmed case, the countries are much closer &#x2013; one case was confirmed for every 55 tests in Australia as of 11 April. A number of issues with the data on testing &#x2013; discussed <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing">here</a> &#x2013; mean that small differences between countries should not be overinterpreted.</p><p>But the very large differences &#x2013; such as those seen between Taiwan, Australia and the UK &#x2013; do tell us something important about the quality of the data.</p><p>A country that performs very few tests for each case it confirms is not testing widely enough for the number of confirmed cases to paint a reliable picture of the true spread of the virus. Whilst those people with the most severe symptoms may have been tested in such countries, there are likely to be many times more people with mild or no symptoms that were never tested.</p><p>Testing in the UK has not kept pace with the advancing outbreak. The number of people tested per confirmed case <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-tests-cases-scatter-with-comparisons?time=1..81&amp;country=TWN+GBR">fell rapidly</a> throughout March and early April &#x2013; from more than 400, to less than 4. The current low level of testing, relative to the size of the outbreak, suggests that the true number of infections in the UK is likely to be far higher than the number of confirmed cases.</p><p>The large number of tests for each confirmed case in Taiwan and Australia suggests that the number of confirmed cases paint a much more reliable picture of the true number of infections in these countries.</p><p>Researchers from the <em>London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</em> &#x2013; Timothy Russel, Joel Hellewell, Sam Abbott and others &#x2013; reach similar conclusions about the UK and Australia via a different method.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> They estimate the degree to which countries&#x2019; confirmed cases may underestimate total symptomatic cases by applying the case fatality rate (we explain this metric in detail <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#what-do-we-know-about-the-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19">here</a>) observed in large studies in China and South Korea to data on the number of COVID-19 deaths in countries around the world.</p><p>They estimate that in Australia the number of confirmed cases reflect more than three quarters of the total number of symptomatic cases in the country. For the UK, they estimate that confirmed cases represent less than one in twenty symptomatic cases.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>As such, the gap between the UK and Australia in terms of the true number of infections is likely to be far higher than that indicated by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-cases-covid-19?country=AUS+TWN+GBR">their confirmed cases</a>.</p><p>The intuition behind these researchers&#x2019; estimates is that where the number of confirmed cases looks low against the number of deaths, this is a clear indication that the true number of cases is likely to be much, much higher. But the fundamental reason for this is the limited extent of testing.</p><p>The rate of tests per case thus gives us another useful way of approaching the same question, by looking at the extent of testing relative to the number of cases directly.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-tests-cases-scatter-with-comparisons?country=AUS+TWN+GBR" class="grapherPreview">

Trackers of the development, regulatory status and commercial release of different types of COVID-19 test are being compiled by <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/COVID-19/serology/Serology-based-tests-for-COVID-19.html">Johns Hopkins University</a> and the medical industry news website, <a href="https://www.360dx.com/coronavirus-test-tracker-launched-covid-19-tests">360Dx</a>.</p><p>Broadly, we can divide these different tests into two kinds:</p><ul><li>those that test for the presence of the virus, aiming to establish whether an individual is currently infected. The most common way of performing a test of the first type is with a &#x2018;PCR&#x2019; test.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></li><li>those that test for the presence of antibodies, aiming to establish whether an individual has been infected at some point in the past.</li></ul><p><strong>Currently, we aim to include only these PCR tests in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#testing-for-covid-19-background-the-our-world-in-data-covid-19-testing-dataset">testing dataset</a></strong>.</p><p>We do this for the following reasons:</p><ol><li>Our focus is on using testing data to help properly interpret the data we have on confirmed cases and deaths. Case confirmation is generally based on a positive result from a PCR test, in line with WHO recommendations.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> So including antibody tests in our figures would mean they were less useful for this purpose.</li><li>Other kinds of test beyond PCR are not yet being widely used. This also means that data on how many of these tests have been conducted is very limited. Including such data in our counts when it is available would reduce the comparability of our data across countries.</li><li>There are technical differences in how results from these different tests should be interpreted. Current data suggests that other existing testing technologies are subject to very different rates of false positive and false negative results than PCR tests.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> This is another reason why aggregating the data across these different types of test is not the best way of using testing data to help us understand the epidemic.</li></ol></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data"></a>Our checklist for COVID-19 testing data</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="we-need-to-understand-what-the-published-numbers-on-testing-mean"><a class="deep-link" href="#we-need-to-understand-what-the-published-numbers-on-testing-mean"></a>We need to understand what the published numbers on testing mean&#xA0;</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Different countries publish their testing data according different definitions. In order to make meaningful comparisons between countries and over time, the figures need to be interpreted alongside an understanding of these differences.</p><p>This means that, in addition to the numbers, detailed descriptions are needed to make clear what the numbers precisely mean. For each country in our dataset, we provide source descriptions detailing all the information that we have been able to find. However, many countries currently do not provide sufficient documentation.</p><p>For citizens to trust and understand the published data, and for countries to learn from each other, it is crucial that every country provides the data on testing in a clearly documented way.</p><p>To help guide users and producers of testing data, we provide the following checklist of questions. Clear answers to these questions are what is needed to properly interpret and compare published numbers.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="our-checklist-of-questions-to-understand-testing-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#our-checklist-of-questions-to-understand-testing-data"></a>Our checklist of questions to understand testing data</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p><strong>1) Is there no data &#x2013; or it is just hard to find?</strong></p><p>Many countries are not yet providing official figures. Others do not do so on a regular basis. The first question to ask, then, is if there is any testing data for a given country.</p><p>Equally important is to make the available data findable. Currently, the available data is often not easy to find, because some countries are releasing figures at unpredictable intervals in ad-hoc locations (including social media or press conferences).</p><p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>What testing technologies are being used?</strong></p><p>There are many different technologies for COVID-19 testing, some of which are already implemented, some currently available but not yet rolled out, and some still in development.&#xA0; As we discuss&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19">here</a>, these different tests are used with different objectives in mind, and there are technical differences in how results from these different testing technologies should be interpreted.&#xA0;</p><p>It&#x2019;s critical that&#xA0;governments provide a detailed and explicit account of the technologies that are being implemented as they get rolled out, disaggregating the test results accordingly. For citizens to trust and understand the published data, and for epidemiologists to incorporate the data into the models that inform public policy, it is crucial that every country provides the data on testing in a clearly documented way.</p><p><strong>3) Do numbers refer to &#x2018;performed tests&#x2019; or &#x2018;individuals tested&#x2019;?</strong></p><p>The number of tests performed is different to the number of individuals tested. The reason for this is that it is common for COVID-19 testing that the same person is tested more than once.</p><p>Some countries report tests performed, while others report the number of individuals tested.</p><p>The source description should state clearly what is counted.</p><p><strong>4) Are negative results included? Are pending results included?</strong></p><p>It needs to be clear whether or not figures for the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested, include negative test results, as well as the number of tests that are pending results.</p><p>Many sources report the number of individuals who are &#x2018;suspected&#x2019; or have been &#x2018;ruled out&#x2019;. To be reliably included in test counts, it needs to be explicit whether such categories reflect the number of people who are awaiting test results or have tested negatively.</p><p><strong>5) Do the figures include all tests conducted in the country, or only some?&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Figures reported by countries may only be partial if not all laboratories are reporting to the central authority.</p><p>The scope of testing data should be made explicit by the source. For instance, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html">US CDC</a> make it clear that their figures do not include tests conducted in private labs.</p><p><strong>6) Are all regions and laboratories within a country submitting data on the same basis?</strong></p><p>Answers to the questions above may vary from region to region. In order to assess the reliability of aggregate testing data, it needs to be clear if heterogenous data is being summed together.</p><p>The <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/">US COVID Tracking Project</a>, for instance makes it clear that their US totals combine data for tests performed and individuals tested, depending on which is reported by individual states.</p><p><strong>7) What period do the published figures refer to?</strong></p><p>Cumulative counts of the total number of tests should make clear the date from which the count begins. The key question that needs to be answered is whether the figures published at some date (attempt to) include all tests conducted up to that date.</p><p>Because the reporting of tests can take several days, for some countries figures for the last few days may not yet be complete. It needs to be made clear by the source if this may be the case. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html">US CDC</a>, for instance, makes this clear.</p><p><strong>8) Are there any issues that affect the comparability of the data over time?</strong></p><p>If we want to look at how testing figures are changing over time, we need to know how any of the factors discussed above may have changed too.</p><p><a href="https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus/covid-19/informatie-voor-professionals/virologische-dagstaten">The Netherlands</a>, for instance, makes it clear that not all labs were included in national estimates from the start. As new labs get included, their past cumulative total gets added to the day they begin reporting, creating spikes in the time series.</p><p><strong>9) What are the typical testing practices in the country?</strong></p><p>Having a sense of how often and when individuals are tested, can help the users of these statistics understand how estimates of tests performed and individuals tested might relate to each other.</p><p>For instance, how many tests does a case investigation require?

<strong>Short description: </strong>The data is described both as the number of tests performed and as the number of tested patients.</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>43.89 per thousand people; 508,697 in total (as of 12 May 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>Sciensano provides a daily time series of the number of tests conducted per day, which is updated retrospectively as new data becomes available each day.<br><br>According to the <a href="https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf">dataset codebook</a>, dates for new testing figures correspond to the date of laboratory diagnosis (or when not available, date of sampling). <br><br>It appears that the reported testing figures represent the number of people tested, but this is not entirely clear. The official website describes the testing dataset as the &#x201C;Dataset of total number of tests performed by date&#x201D;, yet the <a href="https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf">dataset codebook</a> defines the &#x201C;tests&#x201D; variable as the &#x201C;number of tested patients&#x201D;.<br><br>It is also unclear whether the testing figures include antigen tests in addition to PCR tests. In a communication on April 3rd 2020, Sciensano indicates that antigen tests made by Coris Bioconcept may now be used for COVID-19 detection. The communication states that positive antigen test results do not have to be confirmed by a PCR test, but that negative or doubtful cases must be confirmed by a PCR test.<br><br>Official figures reported in Sciensano&#x2019;s daily epidemiological bulletins do not help to clarify these ambiguities. For example, as of May 10th 2020, the <a href="https://epistat.sciensano.be/covid/covid19_historicaldata.html">official time series dataset</a> reported a cumulative total of 465,201 tests performed between March 1st and May 9th. However, the epidemiological bulletin for <a href="https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/COVID-19_Daily%20report_20200510%20-%20FR.pdf">May 10th 2020</a> states that 325,796 cumulative tests had been performed by laboratories between the beginning of March and May 9th, while an additional 240,305 tests had been performed through the national testing platform (566,101 total tests).<br><br>The bulletin indicates that these figures include both PCR and antigen tests, suggesting that the large discrepancy between the 465,201 figure and the 566,101 figure may be solely due to the fact that the official time series data only includes PCR tests, whereas the official bulletin figures include both PCR and antigen tests. However, it is also possible that the discrepancy is due solely to the fact that the official time series data is reported in terms of &#x201C;people tested&#x201D;, whereas the bulletin figures represent &#x201C;tests performed&#x201D;. We have been unable to find official documentation from Sciensano that resolves these ambiguities.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=BEL" class="grapherPreview">

<strong>Short description: </strong>Units unclear.</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>2.51 per thousand people; 44,285 in total (as of 13 May 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>The Government of Ecuador publish daily updates in the form of situation reports and summary infographics. These report the number and status of confirmed cases, deaths and number of samples tested. This data is available daily from 18th March; reports and infographics prior to this date do not include the number of samples tested. But all figures are dated cumulative since 29th February.<br><br>The source reports the number of confirmed (&#x2018;confirmados&#x2019;) and negative (&#x2018;descartados&#x2019;) cases, which we sum to get the number of cases tested.<br><br>On 24 April 2020, the number of tests suddenly jumped from 23,383 to 45,857, because of what we assume to be the inclusion of rapid tests (&#x201C;pruebas r&#xE1;pidas&#x201D;), as made clear by the subsequent infographic published on 27 April. We therefore do not include the 24 April infographic in our time series; and from 27 April onwards, we include only PCR tests.<br><br>On 11 May 2020, the Government of Ecuador published a <a href="https://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BP-VARIACIONES-INFOGRAFIA-No.-074-11052020.pdf">report</a> detailing &#x201C;a reclassification of the records by identity card of the persons and not by the number of tests that have been carried out&#x201D; (via google translate). This suggests the government is moving towards reporting figures on the number of people tested, where previously they reported the number of cases tested. The reclassification partially explains the fall in the cumulative total after 4 May 2020.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=ECU" class="grapherPreview">

We have copied this time-series as presented in the original source. It&#x2019;s important to note that when figures exceed 1000, the Finnish Department of Health and Welfare report samples to the nearest hundred (e.g. 1.6k). <br><br>Further descriptions of the testing data are provided <a href="https://thl.fi/fi/web/infektiotaudit-ja-rokotukset/ajankohtaista/ajankohtaista-koronaviruksesta-covid-19/tilannekatsaus-koronaviruksesta">here</a>. In this document it notes that:<br><br>&#x2013; &#x201C;Public and private sector laboratories report to THL (health authority) the number of samples tested per hospital district&#x201D;<br>&#x2013; &#x201C;The actual number of infections in Finland is probably higher than reported, as not all mild symptoms have been tested so far and no information is available on the number of asymptomatic infections.&#x201D;<br>&#x2013; &#x201C;Coronavirus testing is performed in both the public and private sectors in several laboratories.&#x201D;<br><br>The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: &#x201C;Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy&#x2026;.Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.&#x201D;<br><br>This data series extends to the 27th February, when test figures were very low (9 tests per day).

<strong>Short description: </strong>The number of tests performed. Note that the number of laboratories reporting in the data seems to vary from week to week.</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>37.57 per thousand people; 3,147,771 in total (as of 10 May 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>To determine how many laboratory tests regarding SARS-CoV-2 are carried out per calendar week in Germany and how many tests are positive or negative, the RKI has started a Germany-wide laboratory query. However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.<br><br>The report published on 13 May states that &#x201C;from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 19/2020&#x201D;:<br>&#x2013; The cumulative total of samples tested was 3,147,771;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 19 (which ends 10 May), 173 labs reported 382,154 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 18 (which ends on 3 May), 174 labs reported 325,259 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 17 (which ends on 26 April), 176 labs reported 360,443 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 16 (which ends on 19 April), 167 labs reported 330,027 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 15 (which ends on 12 April), 163 labs reported 379,233 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 154 labs reported 408,348 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 151 labs reported 361,515 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348,619 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127,457 samples tested.<br>&#x2013; Up to and including calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 90 labs reported 124,716 samples tested.<br><br>By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.<br><br>Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=DEU" class="grapherPreview">

These are collated by a volunteer group on <a href="https://github.com/reustle/covid19japan-data/">GitHub</a>. We take our figures from this group, and regularly audit it for accuracy. Daily changes in the number of people tested are included in parentheses. For the 3rd April, the daily changes do not reconcile with the cumulative totals. Moreover, it is clear that revisions to past data are simply added to the new cumulative total, making the time series of &#x2018;daily tests&#x2019; too erratic to be published.<br><br>This includes two cases where the cumulative number of people tested falls: (1) 19/03 and (2) 25/03. For case (1) see footnote 4 which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this. For case (2), we could not find the associated footnote.<br><br>It isn&#x2019;t clear what exact date these cumulative tests date back to, but it is earlier than 10 Feb when the source reports 938 people had been tested. Prior to the 10 Feb, the press releases provide reports of coronavirus infections for the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama port. We do not report these numbers in the time series as it is unclear how they relate to the cumulative totals.<br><br>Google Translate was used while compiling this data so this may affect our interpretation of the data.</p><p><strong>Source #2: </strong><a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/houdou/houdou_list_202004.html">Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Press Release</a><br>

<strong>Short description: </strong>The number of people tested</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>39.23 per thousand people; 212,655 in total (as of 14 May 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>The Norwegian Institute of Public Health produce daily update reports of confirmed cases, deaths and test results. This information includes demographic information of confirmed cases.<br><br>These daily reports state the cumulative number of people who have been tested &#x2013; including the number and share who tested positive. We can use these daily updates to construct a full time-series. Note that the source states that &#x201C;Data for the last few days is incomplete and will be updated in upcoming daily reports&#x201D;, that the &#x201C;Number of tested and proportion of positive findings among the tested is affected by changes in test criteria&#x201D;. It also notes that &#x201C;Laboratory data is now retrieved from the new national laboratory database, which gives us [a] more complete data set with regard to sampling date&#x201D;. Earlier reports noted that &#x201C;The figure contains only numbers from laboratories that have reports that include the sampling date&#x201D; [all via Google Translate]. As such, this seems to imply an increase in coverage across laboratories over time.<br><br>In addition to the aggregate number of people tested, the source provides a regional breakdown, in which it is noted that tests in &#x2018;private labs that analyze tests across the country&#x2019; are excluded. The sum of this breakdown is lower than the aggregate figure provided. We take this as an indication that the main aggregate figure we report includes all private testing.<br><br>Daily reports with figures on testing are only available dating back to 16th March. We therefore do not know the first date of testing, only that as of 16th March, 18062 people had been tested.<br><br>The time of day to which the testing figures relate appears to have changed. Earlier daily reports refers to those tested up until 3pm (local time) of the previous day. More recent reports relate to those tested up until midnight (local time) of the previous day.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=NOR" class="grapherPreview">

This previous breakdown of the test results and COVID-19 dashboard have both been removed. We became aware of this new tracker on the 13th April with data &#x2018;as of April 11 2020, 12am&#x2019;. No previous snapshots of the dashboard are available using web archive, therefore the series starts from the 11th April &#x2013; the earliest date from which we have access to the data.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=PHL" class="grapherPreview">

We were alerted by a Technical Advisor within the Cabinet of the Secretary of Health to the fact that these figures only captures people who were reported through the National System of Epidemiological Surveillance which does not include many of the people that get tested but are never entered into the surveillance system (because they do not meet the criteria and go on to test negatively). For this reason we have now switched to the current series.

The reason for this is not clear. We include only the former date as an observation.

We have used this source to supplement testing data for the 10th April where web archives were not available. The notes to this dashboard provide further elaboration.

<strong>Short description: </strong>The number of tests performed.</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>34.76 per thousand people; 1,625,211 in total (as of 7 May 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>Official data covering the whole of Spain was only published sporadically until the end of April 2020.<br><br>The first estimate in our time series comes from a Ministry of Health press release, quoting Salvador Illa, Minister of Health: &#x201C;From the beginning of the crisis and until April 13, the total number of PCR carried out in Spain is 930,230.&#x201D; The press release is <a href="https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=detalle&amp;id=4864">here</a>.<br><br>The second is another Ministry of Health press release published on 27 April and relating to testing conducted up to 23 April. It provides a breakdown across Autonomous Communities (regions), with a total for Spain of 1,035,522 PCR tests. The same release provides a figure of 310,038 antibody tests conducted nationwide. These are different to the PCR tests, as we discuss <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19">here</a>. Our database aims to not include antibody tests. So in order to provide the data that is most comparable to the other countries in our database, we include only the PCR tests count for this observation.<br><br>One aspect of the 27 April press release that is not totally clear is whether the figures provided for each Autonomous Community relate to the 23 April. Comparing the regional breakdowns provided in the Ministry of Health release to those collected from official sources by CIVIO (as of 28 April) suggests that the figure of 203,892 provided for Madrid in the Ministry of Health update&#x2014;ostensibly dating to the 23 April&#x2014;may date back to 14 April.<br><br>Further data points are collected from the <a href="https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=verHistorico">Ministry of Health&#x2019;s press releases</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/sanidadgob">its Twitter account</a>.<br><br><a href="https://datos.civio.es/dataset/pcr-coronavirus-covid19-espana-comunidades-autonomas/">CIVIO</a> is a non-profit investigative data journalism organisation who are collating information on tests performed within each Autonomous Community, as released through official channels (communication offices, web pages, press releases and social networks of the different regions). We do not report these figures because their data are not complete: For some autonomous communities, figures are available only irregular intervals. The figures they provide are broadly in-line with those of the Ministry of Health releases, although with somewhat lower figures for some Autonomous Communities. This may be due to the Ministry of Health having access to more recent estimates for these Autonomous Communities.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=ESP" class="grapherPreview">

<strong>Short description: </strong>The figures are labelled in the source only as &#x2018;tested&#x2019;. It is unclear whether this relates to the number of individuals tested, or the number of samples tested.</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>2.87 per thousand people; 68,335 in total (as of 13 May 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>The Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control (CDC) host a dashboard in which they publish the total &#x2018;tested&#x2019; to date, and &#x2018;new from yesterday&#x2019;. It is not clear whether this represents the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested. The number &#x2018;tested&#x2019; is greater than the sum of confirmed cases and &#x2018;excluded&#x2019; (i.e. negative) test results. This would suggest it does not equal the total number of people tested, or if it does, pending results without a reported outcome are also included.<br><br>Although the CDC only show the last day&#x2019;s figures on this dashboard, we can construct a time-series by looking at previous versions on web archive. Where possible we have tried to take the total test counts at the same time every day (those published at 00:30h). Unfortunately this time of publishing from CDC was not always completely consistent. This may lead to small discrepancies between &#x2018;total tested&#x2019; and &#x2018;new from &#x2018;yesterday&#x2019; figures. Wherever possible we took the total test count as of 00:30 as the prefered figure; where a day of data was missing we used the &#x2018;new from yesterday&#x2019; figure to calculate the total for the previous day. If there are small discrepancies with other sources, this timing issue is likely to be the cause. In any case it is likely to be minor.<br><br>The date from which the total test figures date back to is not known; the CDC dashboard is unavailable in web archives prior to 21st March.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=TWN" class="grapherPreview">

From 1st April onwards, the number of people who tested negative and the number for whom results are still pending are no longer reported separately.<br><br>We have received communication from Thailand&#x2019;s Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) that individuals who did not meet PUI criteria can pay out of pocket to have their samples tested, referred to as the &#x201C;non-PUI&#x201D; group.

The earliest press release that lists the cumulative total is 6th April. However, we cannot say with certainty when testing began and the precise date from which cumulative totals begin. <br><br>After the 14th April, press releases by the Office of the Director General publishes the daily number of samples tested. We sum the cumulative total number of samples tested for the previous day with the daily number of samples tested today. For example, the total number of samples tested on the 15th April is equal to the cumulative total up until the 14th April plus the number of samples tested on the 15th April. <br><br>For the 18th April, we rely on the figure reported by the MOH official twitter account to calculate our cumulative totals. From the 5th May, we rely on the figures reported by the MOH official twitter account and check figures against press releases where they have been made available by the MOH.  <br><br>We are aware of Uganda&#x2019;s <a href="https://covid19.gou.go.ug/">MOH information portal</a>, however, it only lists the &#x2018;cumulative # tested&#x2019; without specifying more precise units of measurement. Our cumulative totals for the number of samples tested from 19/04 matches the &#x2018;cumulative # tested&#x2019; total in the Uganda information portal for 20/04. This suggests the &#x2018;cumulative # tested&#x2019; refers to the samples tested up until the previous day. However, the cumulative totals diverge from the 29th April.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=UGA" class="grapherPreview">

The data presented are aggregate data reported to CDC from state health departments and territorial jurisdictions and might not represent the most current counts for the most recent 3 days due the time it takes to report testing information. The data may also not include results from all potential testing sites within the jurisdiction (e.g., non-laboratory or point of care test sites) and therefore reflect the majority, but not all, of COVID-19 testing being conducted in the United States. If a state did not report laboratory data for a specific day, or if data reported by states are incomplete, data presented reflect what is reported on the state health department website or laboratory testing data reported to the Department of Health and Human Services.&#x201D;<br><br>The CDC previously published a time series that only covered public health labs and did not include private lab tests, which were occurring in significant numbers.

However, it&#x2019;s unclear whether &#x2018;negative samples&#x2019; includes some instances of resampling for the same person. We therefore cannot say with certainty that these are equivalent.<br><br>Using web archives we can reconstruct a daily time-series of total samples by looking at previous versions of the updated website. These daily updates extend back to 2nd March. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that as of 2nd March 1753 samples had been tested.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=VNM" class="grapherPreview">

The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results. It is not clear how many people have been tested, since the reported figures refer only to the number of tests conducted rather than the number of people tested.<br><br>The press release for May 6th 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 &#x201C;rapid screening&#x201D; tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.<br><br>Prior to May 6th 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on May 6th 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=ZWE" class="grapherPreview">
