Most of their estimates (18 of the 28) of pre-industrial inequalities are based on so-called &#x2018;social tables&#x2019;. In these tables, social classes (or groups) &#x2018;are ranked from the richest to the poorest with their estimated population shares and average incomes&#x2019;.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>The following graph demonstrates the level of economic inequality in&#xA0;pre-industrial societies in relation to the levels of prosperity in those same societies. Inequality is measured with the Gini index (explained <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">below</a>) and prosperity is measured by the&#xA0;gross domestic income&#xA0;per capita, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-PPPs">adjusted for price differences</a>&#xA0;to make comparisons in a common currency possible.</p><p>The graph also shows a curve labelled IPF; this is the <em>Inequality Possibility Frontier</em>. The idea behind this curve is that in a very poor society inequality cannot be very high: Imagine if the <em>average</em> level of income were just the bare minimum to survive, in such an economy there could not possibly be any inequality as this would necessarily mean that some people have to be below the minimum income level on which they could survive.</p><p>When average income is a little higher it is possible to have some small level of inequality, and the IPF shows how the maximum possible inequality increases with higher average income. The authors found&#xA0;that many pre-industrial societies are clustered along the IPF. This means that in these societies, inequality was as high as it possibly could have been.</p><p>In the cases of Holland and England, we see that during their early development they moved away from the IPF and the level of inequality was no longer at the maximum.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Pre-industrial inequalities: Gini coefficients, and the Inequality Possibility Frontier<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Pre-Industrial-Inequality-750x525.png" alt="pre-industrial-inequality" class="wp-image-9299" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Pre-Industrial-Inequality-750x525.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Pre-Industrial-Inequality-150x105.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Pre-Industrial-Inequality-400x280.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Pre-Industrial-Inequality-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Pre-Industrial-Inequality.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="how-has-inequality-in-the-uk-changed-over-the-very-long-run"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-has-inequality-in-the-uk-changed-over-the-very-long-run"></a>How has inequality in the UK changed over the very long run?</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The United Kingdom is the country for which we have the best information on the distribution of income over the very long run. This information is visualized in this chart. The top panel shows the share of total income going to the top 5% of income earners, and the bottom panel shows the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">Gini coefficients</a>.</p><p>The early estimates are based on social tables,&#xA0;and as with most estimates from the more distant past, there is some concern about how accurate these estimates are.&#xA0;Holmes published a detailed ciritique&#xA0;for one of the most famous tables: Gregory King&#x2019;s Social Table for England in 1688. Holmes (1977) showed King&#x2019;s limitations as a social analyst and criticized his social table, arguing that various biases &#x201C;beguiled him (1) into underestimating the number of families in some of the wealthiest, and fiscally most productive classes; and (2) into underestimating (sometimes grossly) income levels at many rungs above the poverty line.&#x201D;<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>However, there are ways to take into account these biases, and&#xA0;the estimates shown in the graph are based on a revision of King&#x2019;s original estimates conducted by Lindert and Williamson. The authors say that they use &#x201C;Holmes&#x2019; penetrating critique (1977) to guide our modification of King&#x2019;s tables&#x201D;.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>The estimates presented in this visualization suggest that inequality in the UK was very high in the past, and did not change much until the onset of industrialization. As we can see, incomes used to be remarkably concentrated: up to 40% of total income went into the pockets of the richest 5%.</p><p>Starting in the late 19th century, income inequality began to decrease dramatically and reached historical lows in the late 1970s. However, during&#xA0;the 1980s inequality increased substantially in the UK and both the Gini and the top income share&#xA0;increased&#xA0;sharply. From the early 1990s onwards, we see that the UK experiences a divergence between what the Gini and the top income shares tell us about inequality. The Gini remained flat over these two decades and, if anything, fell somewhat during this period. This tells us that inequality across the bulk of the distribution has not increased further in the UK. At the very top, however, the evidence shows a different story. We&#xA0;observe that income growth at the very, very top of the income distribution has outstripped the strong growth of incomes across the rest of the distribution.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>More than 700 years of income inequality in the UK measured via income share of the top 5% and Gini, 1980-2010<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Inequality-UK-over-700-years-733x550.png" alt="inequality-uk-over-700-years" class="wp-image-9204" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Inequality-UK-over-700-years-733x550.png 733w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Inequality-UK-over-700-years-150x113.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Inequality-UK-over-700-years-400x300.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Inequality-UK-over-700-years-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Inequality-UK-over-700-years.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="within-country-inequality-in-rich-countries"><a class="deep-link" href="#within-country-inequality-in-rich-countries"></a>Within-country inequality in rich&#xA0;countries</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-has-inequality-in-high-income-countries-evolved-over-the-last-century"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-has-inequality-in-high-income-countries-evolved-over-the-last-century"></a>How has inequality in high-income countries evolved over the last century?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Researchers have a much better understanding of the long run evolution of income inequality thanks to the&#xA0;recent wave of&#xA0;research on top income shares.</p><p>Top income inequality is measured as the share of total income that goes to the income earners at the very top of the distribution. Usually the top 1%.</p><p>Historical top income inequality estimates are reconstructed from income tax records, and for many countries these estimates give us insights into the evolution of inequality over more than 100 years. This is much longer than other estimates of income inequality allow (as is the case with estimates that rely on income survey data).</p><p>The fact that income shares are measured through tax records implies that these estimates measure inequality before redistribution through taxes and transfers.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>What we can learn from this long-term perspective is summarized in this visualization. Consider the case of the USA,&#xA0;in the&#xA0;left panel. Before the Second World War up to 18% of all income received by Americans went to the richest 1%. After that point, and up until the early 1980s, the share of the top 1% dropped substantially&#xA0;(first quickly, and then more slowly in the 1970s)</p><p>After the 1980s inequality in the USA started increasing, and eventually returned to the level of the pre-war period. We see that this U-shaped long-term trend of top income shares is not unique to the USA. In fact the development in other English-speaking countries, also shown in the left panel, follows the same pattern.</p><p>However, it would be wrong to think that increasing top income inequality is a universal phenomenon. In the right panel&#xA0;we see that in equally rich European countries, as well as in Japan, the development is in fact quite different. The income share of the rich has decreased over many decades, and just like in the English-speaking countries, it reached a low point in the 1970s. In contrast to the English-speaking countries, however, top income shares have not returned to earlier high levels; they have instead&#xA0;remained flat or increased only modestly. The evolution of top&#xA0;income inequality followed an L-shape here. Income inequality in Europe and Japan is much lower today than it was at the beginning of the 20th century.</p><p>A lesson that that we can take away from this empirical research is that political forces at work on the national level are likely important for how incomes are distributed. A universal trend of increasing inequality would be in line with the notion that inequality is determined by global market forces and technological progress. The reality of different inequality trends within countries suggests that the institutional and political frameworks in different countries also play a role in shaping inequality of incomes. This means that rising inequality is most likely not inevitable.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes-750x536.png" alt="Top incomes" class="wp-image-19898" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes-750x536.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes-150x107.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes-400x286.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="inequality-before-or-after-taxes"><a class="deep-link" href="#inequality-before-or-after-taxes"></a>Inequality before or after taxes?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>It is important to emphasize that the top income measures of inequality that we <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#how-has-inequality-in-high-income-countries-evolved-over-the-last-century">discuss above</a> refer to inequality in the distribution of <em>market</em> incomes.&#xA0;And market incomes are not the same as <em>disposable</em> incomes, because most people pay taxes and receive transfers from the government.</p><p>In many countries governments have <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/#how-progressive-is-taxation-at-the-top-of-the-income-distribution-in-developed-countries">progressive tax systems</a>.

different world regions. The best source for distributional data with global coverage is the World Bank&#x2019;s PovcalNet. But even for this source, global coverage comes at the cost of comparability. Crucially, the PovcalNet data relies on consumption surveys for some countries and income surveys for other countries. As we point out <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#how-does-income-inequality-differ-from-consumption-inequality">above</a>, this is problematic.</p><p>Notwithstanding these limitations, it is interesting to consider the world map of economic inequality.&#xA0;Both the southern part of Africa and Latin America stand out as&#xA0;regions with very high&#xA0;inequality.&#xA0;South-East Asia and most&#xA0;rich countries on the other hand&#xA0;have relatively low levels of inequality.</p><p>You can click on countries with available data to explore detailed country-specific trends.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-inequality-gini-index" class="grapherPreview">

The US is an exception when it comes to income inequality.</p><p>Research shows that in the US the &#x2018;ultra-rich&#x2019; are the group that has experienced the largest income growth in the recent period of growing income inequality. This is shown in the following chart. Each dot along the horizontal axis represents a different percentile in the income distribution, with the height marking the corresponding average level of income growth in the period 1980-2014 (after adjusting for inflation). Red and blue, respectively, show changes in incomes before and after taxes.</p><p>The chart comes from Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2016) and it has received <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html">substantial media coverage</a>.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>As we can see, the poorest individuals in the US have seen no real income growth in the period 1980-2014; while at the very top, the ultra-rich have enjoyed an average annual growth of about 6%. Without taxes and transfers, those at the bottom have actually seen their incomes shrinking.</p><p>Another striking fact is that the relationship is monotonically increasing: independently of where you are in the US income distribution, those who are richer have seen larger income growth. This doesn&#x2019;t need to be the case. In fact, as Piketty and co-authors point out, in the US the relationship used to be monotonically <em>decreasing</em>: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-1980-vs-2014.png">independently of where you were in the income distribution, those who were poorer used to enjoy larger income growth</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Average annual income growth in the US over the period 1980-2014 &#x2013; Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2016)<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes-750x468.png" alt="Piketty saez zucman 2016 2014 before and after taxes" class="wp-image-14044" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes-750x468.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes-150x94.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes-400x250.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes-768x479.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes.png 1256w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="inequality-in-different-world-regions"><a class="deep-link" href="#inequality-in-different-world-regions"></a>Inequality in different world regions</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="latin-america-is-the-world-region-with-the-highest-income-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#latin-america-is-the-world-region-with-the-highest-income-inequality"></a>Latin America is the world region with the highest income inequality</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>This visualization shows a comparison of income inequality across different world regions.

Under this line of reasoning, one could argue that globalization increases inequality in rich countries because &#x2018;losers&#x2019; are more likely to be those with low incomes in the first place.</p><p>The available empirical evidence on the causal link between globalization and inequality is not definitive, but does suggest that we might want to take this hypothesis seriously.

Indeed, in the preceding section we argued that trade and technology may increase income inequality precisely by making the skills of some individuals less valuable relative to others.</p><p>However, economists also tend to agree that, while relevant, differences in productivity are not sufficient to explain differences in incomes. Social conventions, for example, also play a crucial role. In the words of Atkinson (2015)<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a> &#x201C;supply and demand determine a range of possible pay, and social conventions determine the location within that range &#x2013; the extent of pay dispersion depends on both elements.&#x201D;</p><p>The implication is that market forces provide only bounds on outcomes, and there is scope for notions of fairness to affect inequality.</p><p>As the charts show, inequality is not universally viewed as inherently undesirable. The estimates come from the World Values Survey, where people are asked to locate their preferences for inequality in a range from 1 to 10 (where 1 implies agreement with the statement &#x201C;Income should be more equal&#x201D;, and 10 implies agreement with the statement &#x201C;We need larger income differences as incentives for individual effort.&#x201D;) These estimates have been calculated at the global level, as well as at the regional level.<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></p><p>The top panel here represents the frequency of responses at each point in the 1-10 scale explained above. As a global average, we see substantial polarization: most people picked one of the extremes (either a high preference for equal incomes, or strong opposition to a reduction in inequality).</p><p>Notice that this polarization is even more pronounced in particular regions. While trends across Europe, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa tend to be roughly similar to the average global pattern of responses; results are more polarized in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa. Latin Americans tended to be much more supportive of more equal incomes, whereas the opposite was true in the Middle East.</p><p>In the bottom panel we see how these responses correlate with income. To be specific, we see average responses by income deciles (where 1 on the x-axis is the lowest income decile and 10 the highest). Across all regions, we see that richer individuals tend to be less inclined to favour a reduction in inequality (i.e. they see it as an important incentive); whereas those on lower incomes favour greater equality.</p><p>Regional differences, however, are still significant. In particular, in comparison to global averages, the correlation in Europe &amp; Central Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa is less pronounced; while in East Asia, and most notably South Asia, the correlation is stronger.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Views on inequality, by world region and relative income position<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality-536x550.png" alt="Views on inequality" class="wp-image-12126" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality-536x550.png 536w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality-146x150.png 146w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality-390x400.png 390w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality-768x788.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality-32x32.png 32w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality-50x50.png 50w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality.png 1809w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="is-there-a-link-between-bargaining-power-and-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#is-there-a-link-between-bargaining-power-and-inequality"></a>Is there a link between bargaining power and inequality?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>We have already pointed out that differences in productivity are not generally sufficient to explain differences in incomes.

The following two visualizations show this, by comparing the degree of income inequality (Gini coefficients), before and after taxes and transfers.</p><p>The static chart gives an overview across all OECD countries using the available estimates from 2012-2014. The interactive chart relies on the same definitions and data sources.</p><p>In both charts income before redistribution refers to market earnings before taxes and transfers (wages and salaries, self-employment income, capital and property income). Income after redistribution, on the other hand, corresponds to disposable income after taxes and transfers (market income, plus social security, cash transfers and private transfers, minus income taxes). In the 2008 OECD report <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/growingunequalincomedistributionandpovertyinoecdcountries.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Growing unequal? </em></a> you can find further details regarding how incomes are measured.</p><p>As we can see, taxes and transfers do reduce inequality significantly: in all countries there is less inequality after redistribution takes place via taxes and transfers. Interestingly, however, the achieved reductions in inequality vary considerably between countries, and substantial cross-country heterogeneity in inequality remains after redistribution.</p><p>In Northern Europe, for example, within-country Gini coefficients after taxes and transfers are below 0.28. In the US and Latin America, Gini coefficients after redistribution are above 0.39. As a benchmark, 0.39 is the Gini coefficient in Iceland <em>before</em> redistribution.</p><p>The interactive visualization presents the same idea in a different view. The horizontal and vertical axis shows, respectively, Gini coefficients before and after redistribution. Along the diagonal line, incomes do not change after redistribution. Hence, the countries further below the diagonal line are those where taxes and transfers have the largest effect on incomes.</p><p>As we can see, European countries (shown in yellow) tend to achieve more redistribution than other OECD countries.

Here we focus on the proportional magnitude of such reductions.</p><p>The following visualization shows the percentage point reduction in Gini coefficients that OECD countries achieve through redistribution. Here, the definitions of incomes before and after taxes and transfers is the same as in the previous two graphs.</p><p>These estimates show that across the 24 countries covered, taxes and transfers lower income inequality by around one-third on average (equivalent to around 0.15 Gini points). Yet cross-country differences are substantial, with declines ranging from about 45% in Denmark and Sweden, to about 8% in South Korea. The US&#x2014;a country with high baseline levels of inequality&#x2014;achieves a reduction of around 17%, which is almost half of the OECD average.</p><p>Generally speaking, countries that achieve the largest inequality reductions through taxes and transfers tend to be those with the lowest after-tax inequality.</p><p>While informative for the purpose of cross-country comparisons, these results have to be interpreted carefully, since the before-tax distribution of incomes is already the result of choices made by individuals who take taxes and transfers into consideration. Put simply, the before-tax distributions of incomes are likely to be different to the actual distributions of incomes that would be in place if there were no taxes or transfers. This can be clearly explained in the context of pensions: individuals receiving state pensions appear in the data as poor before transfers; but many of them would of course have private pensions if they lived in a country without state transfers.</p><p>Another point to keep in mind when studying these estimates is that inequality is not only reduced by redistribution between individuals at a given point in time, but also by achieving redistribution over the course of life. Indeed, pensions have scope for reducing within-country inequality by allowing redistribution of incomes between generations. The estimates in the chart reflect this.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/tax-reduction-in-inequality" class="grapherPreview">

It is for example possible that inequality leads to less economic growth via political instability and social unrest. But it is also possible that it leads to more economic growth via higher incentives for people to make productive investments.</p><p>Available OECD data shows that there is a negative correlation between inequality and economic growth across different subnational regions, within Europe, and also within OECD countries in the Americas. The visualization shows this as well, focusing on Europe.</p><p>This chart is a scatter plot, where each dot represents a different sub-national region. France, for example, is divided here in 22 different regions. For each of these sub-national regions, the vertical axis measures the average annual growth rate of GDP per capita in the period 2008-2012, and the horizontal axis measures inequality in 2007 (Gini coefficients). As we can see, there is a clear negative correlation: regions with more inequality in 2007 experienced less average growth in the subsequent years.</p><p>The above correlation does not imply causation. Indeed, the empirical literature on the causal effect of inequality on economic growth is largely inconclusive.

We would especially warn that estimates of the densities near the bottom and top tails of the distribution could be quite unreliable, and no attempt has been made by the Bank&#x2019;s staff to validate the tool for such purposes.&#x201D;<br> </em></li></ul></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="incomes-across-the-distribution-database"><a class="deep-link" href="#incomes-across-the-distribution-database"></a>Incomes across the Distribution Database</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><ul><li><strong>Data:</strong> Household disposable income by income decile for the working-age population and for the entire population.
