However, as the chart shows, full vaccine use &#x2013; that is a 100% coverage globally &#x2013; could have prevented an additional 83,200 deaths.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a> This means that, even at the current rates of efficacy, 53% of all deaths in children under-5 from rotavirus in 2016 could have been avoided by full vaccine coverage. </p><p>In addition to saving lives, the rotavirus vaccine also reduces the burden on healthcare systems.

However, in addition to delivering the vaccine for those who need it, we also need to work on improving its efficacy.</p><p>Vaccine efficacy for the rotavirus vaccine is defined as the percentage reduction of the rate of diarrhea incidences in vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups of children. It is well established that the efficacy of the rotavirus vaccine is not the same across all countries &#x2014; in countries with high child mortality rates the vaccine shows much lower efficacy.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p><p>The chart is from a recent study by Clark et <em>al.</em>, which looked at how the efficacy of live oral rotavirus vaccines changes in different countries following vaccination. The chart shows that in countries with high child mortality rates, not only is the immediate vaccine efficacy lower &#x2013; 98% in low child mortality countries versus 66% in high child mortality countries &#x2013; but also the vaccine efficacy decreases faster in high child mortality countries over time.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p> Five years after vaccination, the rotavirus vaccine reduces the chances of getting diarrhea by 90% in low child mortality countries and only by 30% in high mortality countries.</p><p>The table shows how good the rotavirus vaccine is at preventing severe diarrhea and reducing hospitalization due to diarrhea in children under-5 in different regions.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p> In high-income countries, rotavirus vaccination has been shown to reduce the cases of severe rotavirus diarrhea by 91% and hospitalization by 94%. In Eastern Asia and Latin America, the effectiveness rates are lower but still high &#x2013; preventing 88% and 80% of severe diarrhea cases, respectively. However, effectiveness in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa is significantly lower, only reducing severe diarrhea in around half of the cases.</p><p>The reasons for different responses to the vaccine are not entirely clear.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p> It is likely that the gut responses to the oral rotavirus vaccines in children in lower-income countries are different. This may be due to a variety of causes, including <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/micronutrient-deficiency">micronutrient deficiencies</a>, pre-vaccination exposure to certain pathogens, and the presence of chronic conditions such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria">malaria</a> or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids">HIV</a>. Overall, the poor gut response to the live vaccine means the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced. Taking all of the above mentioned points into account, there are several interventions that could increase the benefits of the rotavirus vaccine even further. In addition to increasing the vaccine coverage, improving nutritional health (of both infants and mothers) and improving hygiene and sanitation conditions (to lower the prevalence of damaging pathogens) could have positive effects on the vaccine&#x2019;s efficacy.</p><p>We are still at quite an early stage of the rotavirus vaccine use. Although the vaccine has brought huge benefits already, it could go even further. Improving vaccination coverage, particularly across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is key to continued reduction of childhood deaths from diarrhea. Even at moderate levels of vaccine efficacy, a significant number of additional additional child deaths could be prevented every year. The bar chart above that shows the number of preventable deaths illustrates the potential for extended vaccine coverage to save many more lives. And this is already taking into account the regional differences in the vaccine&#x2019;s effectiveness.</p><p>In addition to increased coverage, improving the effectiveness of the vaccine would go even further in tackling one of the leading causes of death.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Rotavirus-vaccine-efficacy-by-child-mortality-group-1-748x550.png" alt="Rotavirus vaccine efficacy by child mortality group 1" class="wp-image-24252" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Rotavirus-vaccine-efficacy-by-child-mortality-group-1-748x550.png 748w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Rotavirus-vaccine-efficacy-by-child-mortality-group-1-150x110.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Rotavirus-vaccine-efficacy-by-child-mortality-group-1-400x294.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Rotavirus-vaccine-efficacy-by-child-mortality-group-1-768x564.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Rotavirus-vaccine-efficacy-by-child-mortality-group-1.png"></figure></div><div class="tableContainer"><table id="tablepress-114" class="tablepress tablepress-id-114">

Oral rehydration therapy (ORT, also referred to as ORS) is one of the most common treatments used to prevent dehydration caused by diarrhea.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p><p>ORT is an incredibly simple therapy: a mixture of water, salt and sugar. It can be administered orally, without the need for special medical assistance. Simple as it may seem, the medical journal <em>The Lancet</em> has called ORT <em>&#x201C;the most important medical advance of the 20th century&#x201D;</em>.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><p> You can read more about the biological mechanism of how ORT works <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fE-_uWIw1DGBjc_Gel6dOcqC-7iYH0b3J7ABkpof54o/edit#bookmark=id.g8da6wjljbit">here</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-was-ort-developed"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-was-ort-developed"></a>How was ORT developed?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>When it comes to &#x201C;the most important medical advances&#x201D; and life-saving interventions, we often think about expensive drugs and complicated surgeries that were discovered and perfected in sophisticated laboratories. ORT defies these expectations. Not only is it low-tech and cheap (only <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fE-_uWIw1DGBjc_Gel6dOcqC-7iYH0b3J7ABkpof54o/edit#bookmark=id.gsa2of7kcmpf">around 0.50$ per treatment course</a>), but it was also developed far away from the world&#x2019;s leading hospitals, under often challenging circumstances.</p><p>The early hospital trials for ORT in the late 1960s were performed by Drs Richard Cash and David Nalin in Dacca, in today&#x2019;s Bangladesh. The most common treatment for diarrhea at the time was the much more expensive <em>intravenous rehydration therapy</em> (IVT), which involved the administration of saline solution intravenously in hospital settings. While IVT was an effective treatment, Cash and Nalin recognized the need for an alternative treatment because the people most affected by diarrheal disease were those who did not have access to clinical centers where IVT was available. In addition, the possibilities of scaling-up IVT use during large outbreaks of diseases &#x2013; such as cholera epidemics &#x2013; were limited.</p><p>In the late 1960s Cash and Nalin conducted a number of small clinical trials during cholera epidemics in the region, which showed the promise of ORT.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a> However, the most significant proof of ORT effectiveness came from desperate circumstances during the Indo-Pakistani War in 1971.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a> The conditions of war, complicated by the monsoon season, displaced millions of people into refugee camps, which ultimately led to a disastrous cholera outbreak. Early during the outbreak almost 30% of the afflicted patients died due to the shortage of the IVT therapy. Pressed by the disastrous circumstances, Dr Dilip Mahalanabis decided to start providing bags of salt and sugar dissolved in water to the people in the camp. The decision by Dr Mahalanabis proved to be the right one: in just a few months the case-fatality ratio from cholera and cholera-like diarrheal diseases fell below 4% among the people treated with ORT, as compared with the 30% ratio observed previously. This success was a major stepping stone for wider adoption of ORT.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p>While ORT is a simple, low-tech solution for the treatment of diarrhea &#x2013; a major public health issue &#x2013; it took many years for its use to be accepted. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1978 that the World Health Organization (WHO) created the diarrheal disease control program that has helped to popularise the use of ORT worldwide.<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a> To put this into perspective &#x2013; we only adopted the use of ORT more than a decade after we landed on the Moon.</p><p>There are many reasons why the uptake and recognition of ORT by richer countries was slow. Western doctors were skeptical of adopting treatments tested in developing countries and considered these to be of a lower standard.<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a> The idea that drinking a simple water, sugar, and salt solution, was just as good of a treatment as a &#x201C;sophisticated&#x201D; intravenous drip seemed radical at the time. And, even today, ORT treatment seems counterintuitive, because, while it reduces the likelihood of death and speeds up recovery, it does not actually prevent or stop diarrhea.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="ort-saves-lives"><a class="deep-link" href="#ort-saves-lives"></a>ORT saves lives</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>How many lives has ORT saved? The exact number is in some ways impossible to know because many other interventions and treatments have contributed to the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-diarrheal-diseases-by-age">decreasing number of deaths from diarrheal diseases</a>. However, the incredible decline in deaths from diarrheal diseases in children in the last two decades of the 20th century (from around 4.8 million annual deaths in 1980 to 1.2 million deaths in 2000) has coincided with an expanded global use of ORT. A number of researchers have suggested that the dramatic decline was not just a coincidence but directly caused by the increased ORT use.<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a> Twelve years ago Fontaine, Garner, and Bhan estimated that more than 50 million children have been saved by ORT between 1982 and 2007 &#x2013; that is on average of 2 million lives a year.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a> Based on these estimates the number of children saved from 1982 until 2019 by ORT could be more than 70 million. Whatever the exact number of lives saved is, it would not be an overstatement to say that many adults would not be alive today if not for the discovery of ORT.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="ort-could-still-go-further"><a class="deep-link" href="#ort-could-still-go-further"></a>ORT could still go further</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>We are not benefiting from the full potential of ORT. The main reason for this is that it is not as widely used as it could be. As the map shows, the coverage of ORT is still low.</p><p>According to data from UNICEF, on average only 44% of children with diarrhea receive ORT (you can view this data on the Chart tab in the interactive visualization).<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a> In some countries the coverage is very low, at less than 1-in-5.</p><p>Of course, one has to ask: does every child with diarrhea need ORT? According to the current WHO guidelines, the need for ORT should be determined based on the degree of child&#x2019;s dehydration.<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a> If a child has diarrhea but is not dehydrated, home treatment with fluids that contain salt, such as rice water or chicken stock, is sufficient. If a packet of ORT salts is available it can be used but is not a necessary treatment. If a child has moderate or severe dehydration, ORT should be given. According to a study conducted in 2012, 35.2% of all diarrheal cases in children were classified as moderate or severe, suggesting that at least a third of diarrheal instances should have been treated with ORT: in 2012 that accounted for 588 million diarrheal episodes.<a id="ref-31" class="ref" href="#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a></p><p>Greater promotion and education about the use of ORT in healthcare facilities and community centers could potentially increase ORT coverage.

The study looked at all the available literature on ORT at the time and suggested that, if every child who needs ORT would receive it, 93% of child deaths caused by diarrhea could be prevented.<a id="ref-33" class="ref" href="#note-33"><sup>33</sup></a></p><p> This implies a huge potential for ORT.</p><p>We should be somewhat cautious, however. The study is the only currently available published research review that measures the effectiveness of ORT. And because there are only a few studies that have looked at how providing ORT directly affects child mortality, the 93% figure was determined based on a very small sample. Furthermore, it should be noted that children with diarrhea often have associated comorbidities, such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">malnutrition</a> and viral or bacterial infections. These comorbidities may require treatments in addition to ORT, which was not assessed in the Munos et <em>al.</em> study.<a id="ref-34" class="ref" href="#note-34"><sup>34</sup></a> <a id="ref-35" class="ref" href="#note-35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a id="ref-36" class="ref" href="#note-36"><sup>36</sup></a> Organizations including WHO, UNICEF and GiveWell cite the 93% figure, but also note its limitations.<a id="ref-37" class="ref" href="#note-37"><sup>37</sup></a></p><p>World Health Organization, and Unicef. &#x201C;Ending preventable child deaths from pneumonia and Diarrhea by 2025: the integrated global action plan for pneumonia and Diarrhea (GAPPD).&#x201D; (2013).</p><p>Another notable study published in <em>The Lancet</em> in 2003 estimated the potential of ORT and other treatments to prevent all-cause child mortality.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a> This study concluded that, in the year 2000, 88% of deaths from diarrheal diseases could have been prevented if available treatments and interventions were used to their full extent.

But even if we are cautious and consider these figures overestimates, the evidence still suggests that ORT could be saving hundreds of thousands of more lives if its coverage was increased.</p><p>It is worth noting that the potential of ORT does not stop at saving the lives of children.

While drinking water can compensate for some water loss, passive absorption of water through the gut cells is not enough to fully compensate in severe diarrheal cases and the accompanying loss of electrolytes in the stool has negative effects on many bodily functions.</p><p>ORT works because of the molecular mechanisms that govern sugar and sodium absorption inside the gut. The cells that make up the lining of the gut have special receptors on their surfaces that allow them to actively absorb sugar molecules. Research by Robert K. Crane and others has shown that the presence of sodium ions in the gut lumen is essential for this process.<a id="ref-42" class="ref" href="#note-42"><sup>42</sup></a> <a id="ref-43" class="ref" href="#note-43"><sup>43</sup></a> <a id="ref-44" class="ref" href="#note-44"><sup>44</sup></a> <a id="ref-45" class="ref" href="#note-45"><sup>45</sup></a></p><p> The increase in sugar and sodium inside the cells leads to increased absorption of water and chloride ions as well. When a patient receives a mixture of sugar and salts dissolved in water it offsets the loss of these essential ions and molecules in patients with diarrhea.</p><p>The recommended formulation of the amounts of electrolytes and sugars in ORT has changed over time. It&#x2019;s now often supplemented with other recommended fluids and zinc, which have been shown to improve recovery time and decrease the likelihood of another diarrheal episode in the short term.<a id="ref-46" class="ref" href="#note-46"><sup>46</sup></a></p><p><strong>Oral rehydration therapy vs. intravenous rehydration therapy</strong><br>Despite being a low-tech solution, ORT is highly effective.

According to UNICEF, it costs around $0.50 to provide a course of ORT in lower-income countries and while the saline solution used for IVT is not much more expensive, the additional costs of medical staff, equipment, hospital stay and a longer course of treatment amount to a significant difference in the price of treatment.<a id="ref-49" class="ref" href="#note-49"><sup>49</sup></a></p><p> In clinical settings in the UK, ORT has been estimated to be between &#xA3;351.84 and &#xA3;630.48 cheaper per course of treatment than IVT.<a id="ref-50" class="ref" href="#note-50"><sup>50</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>ORS composition recommended by the WHO and UNICEF<a id="ref-47" class="ref" href="#note-47"><sup>47</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/ORT-composition-588x550.png" alt="Ort composition" class="wp-image-24296" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/ORT-composition-588x550.png 588w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/ORT-composition-150x140.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/ORT-composition-400x374.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/ORT-composition-768x718.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/ORT-composition.png 1006w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/ORT-composition.png"></figure></div></div></div></section>

<p>The cost of rotavirus vaccines varies by country. For example, countries with a gross national income per capita of less than US$1,000 receive subsidies from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, and there the cost per dose is <a href="https://www.unicef.org/supply/files/Rotavaccine.pdf">set between US$2.10 &#8211; 3.20</a>. With additional co-financing options can reduce the costs <a href="https://www.sabin.org/sites/sabin.org/files/frederic_debellut.pdf">down to US$0.13</a>. In high-income countries, such as the US, the cost per dose is between <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/index.html">US$70 and 95</a></p>



<p>Countries are more likely to introduce the vaccine if the political environment is favourably disposed towards them.
