Two phenomena are illustrated here. First, Swedish data which pre-dates an effective means against smallpox (in 1796) shows the large disease burden and endemicity of smallpox in the 18th century. In peak years, up to 7 out of 1000 Swedes died of smallpox and the volatile nature of outbreaks is a symptom of a disease being endemic (explained in our section on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox#regularity-and-severity">epidemiological definitions</a> further below).</p><p>Second, it can be seen that among selected countries, those that had adopted vaccination legislation earlier saw their smallpox death rates decrease more substantially and suffered fewer casualties during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71.

As a consequence&#xA0;they developed a procedure that involved the nasal inhalation of dried smallpox scabs by three-year-olds.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></p><p> Another commonly practiced technique (whose geographic and temporal origin are unknown) encompassed the injection of the liquid found inside the pustules of a smallpox patient underneath the skin of a healthy person. This would usually result in a milder infection of smallpox after which the person was immune against the disease.&#xA0;Both practices became known as variolation (inoculation) techniques.</p><p>The disadvantage of variolation, however, was that during the course of the mild infection the person became a carrier of the disease and could infect other people. Additionally, it was difficult to control the severeness of the infection which sometimes developed into a full-blown smallpox case that could lead to the person&#x2019;s death.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p><p> This meant that the practice <em>usually</em> reduced the severeness of an infection and the likelihood of deaths but that it would never lead to eliminating the virus. If anything, it helped to spread the virus in a population even further and thereby encouraged its survival.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="institutionalized-variolation"><a class="deep-link" href="#institutionalized-variolation"></a>Institutionalized variolation</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>A British ambassador&#x2019;s wife, Lady Mary Wortley Montague (1869-1762) was the force that pushed for government-mandated variolation in England. She herself had suffered a smallpox infection and lost her younger brother to the disease at the age of 26. She first learned about variolation when she arrived in Istanbul in 1717, where variolation was commonly practiced. She later had the embassy inoculate her two children.</p><p>News spread among the royal family and after following trials Maitland successfully inoculated the two daughters of the Princess of Wales in 1722. Thereafter, variolation became a common practice in Great Britain and became known in other European countries. It became an even more established practice when the French King Louis XV died of smallpox in May of 1776 and his successor and grandson Louis XVI was inoculated with the variola virus one month later.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="vaccine-against-smallpox"><a class="deep-link" href="#vaccine-against-smallpox"></a>Vaccine against smallpox</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>At the end of the 18th century British surgeon and physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) pioneered the first ever vaccination against an infectious disease. He himself had been inoculated with smallpox at the age of 8 and later as a surgeon, variolation was part of his work.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a> He observed that people who had suffered from <em>cowpox</em> would subsequently have a very mild, if at all visible reaction to the smallpox variolation. At the time unknowingly, he had discovered that the cowpox and variola viruses were members of the same orthopoxvirus family.</p><p>He hypothesized that variolation using the cowpox virus would protect children against smallpox as well. Since cowpox infections were much milder and never fatal, this would eliminate the problem of variolated children being carriers of smallpox and sometimes dying of the virus developing into a full-blown infection. On top of protection against the symptoms, it could reduce the stock of humans that the variola virus needed for survival and brought elimination and eventually eradication of smallpox into the realm of possibility.</p><p>In May 1796, Jenner inoculated a boy with cowpox, and then a few months later with the smallpox virus. When the boy did not develop any smallpox symptoms in response to being variolated, his hypothesis of the cowpox offering protection from smallpox was confirmed motivating his further research trials.</p><p>Initially, Jenner faced major barriers to spreading the word about his discovery. When he submitted a paper outlining his findings to&#xA0;the journal <em>Philosophical Transactions</em> edited by the Royal Society, it was rejected. They even advised him not to pursue his ideas any further, pointing to the detrimental impact on his career and reputation. Undeterred, he published his work with an increased number of trials at his own expense two years later (in 1798). He also went on to convince colleagues and supply them with vaccines in other British cities of his new procedure that became known as vaccination (derived from the Latin word for cow, <em>vacca</em>).</p><p>By 1802, the British Parliament did acknowledge his important contribution and awarded him &#xA3;30,000. Meanwhile, vaccination had spread to most of Europe and New England.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></p><p> His 1798 publication <em>Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox&#xA0;</em>had been translated into German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, and Latin within three years. US President Thomas Jefferson figured importantly in the widespread application of vaccination throughout the United States and in 1806, he thanked Edward Jenner in a letter for his discovery and famously predicted &#x201C;Future generations will know by history only that the loathsome smallpox existed and by you has been extirpated.&#x201D;<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a></p><p>The dramatic decline in smallpox fatalities in response to Jenner&#x2019;s vaccine can be traced in the chart, which shows the number of deaths due to smallpox as a share of all deaths in London from 1629 to 1902.&#xA0;Before the introduction of a smallpox vaccine in 1796, on average 7.6% (1-in-13) of all deaths were caused by smallpox. Following introduction of the vaccine, we see a clear decline in smallpox deaths.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-in-london" class="grapherPreview">

This shifted the fight against smallpox from a national to international agenda.&#xA0;It was also the first time that global data collection on the prevalence of smallpox was undertaken.</p><p>By 1959, the World Health Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization (WHO) had passed a resolution to eradicate smallpox globally. It was not until 1966, however, that the WHO provided the &#x2018;Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program&#x2019; with funding to increase efforts for smallpox eradication.</p><p>By 1966, the number of infections of smallpox had already substantially been reduced by national governments&#x2019; efforts.&#xA0;Nonetheless, skepticism about the feasibility of eradication prevailed and the WHO lacked experience in administering projects that required both technical and material support, as well as coordination across countries. Furthermore, the funding provided to the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Programme was insufficient to meet global needs, resulting mostly in vaccine shortages.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p>Further still, continued globalization and growth of international air travel resulted in the continual re-introduction of the disease into countries that had previously managed to eliminate smallpox.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="overcoming-the-last-mile-problem-ring-vaccination"><a class="deep-link" href="#overcoming-the-last-mile-problem-ring-vaccination"></a>Overcoming the last mile problem: ring vaccination</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Smallpox&#x2019;s eradication was greatly spurred by making use of the fact that smallpox transmission occurs via air droplets.&#xA0;Initially, the WHO had pursued a strategy of mass vaccination which attempted to vaccinate as many people as possible, hoping that herd immunity (explained in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#how-vaccines-work-herd-immunity-and-reasons-for-caring-about-broad-vaccination-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vaccine entry</a>) would protect the whole population. Soon, however, vaccination efforts were targeted locally around smallpox cases as smallpox was transmitted by sick patients&#x2019; air droplets. This is known as the <strong>ring vaccination principle</strong>.</p><p>People who had been in direct contact with a smallpox patient over the last two weeks were quarantined and vaccinated. The downside of such an approach was that the virus could spread easily if it was re-introduced from overseas. This was the case in Bangladesh, for example,&#xA0;which had previously eliminated smallpox until 1972 when it was brought back from across its border with India.<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p><p>Despite the risk of re-introductions, ring vaccination greatly reduced the cost of the eradication campaign.

Angus Deaton (2013) makes this claim based on a book by Razzell (1977), which reviews existing birth, baptism and burial records in various counties of 18th century Britain.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a> <a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a> Whilst some anecdotal evidence suggests smallpox deaths declined over the course of the 18th century, we cannot be sure that the spread of inoculation practices were the cause of that decline. Furthermore, the local communities for which records were available may not have been representative of Great Britain as a whole. Such evidence therefore seems insufficient to show a causation relationship between inoculation and increases in life expectancy.</p><p>It is hard to prove such claims because of the lack of and low quality of data on both life expectancy and smallpox cases/deaths prior to the invention of Jenner&#x2019;s vaccine in 1796. Whilst we have presented data on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-in-london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smallpox deaths in <em>London</em></a> dating back to 1629, we only know the aggregate&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?tab=chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">life expectancy of Great Britain</a>&#xA0;(rather than London specifically) over this period. It&#x2019;s unlikely that London&#x2019;s smallpox deaths are nationally representative which means that the direct comparison is not possible.</p><p>When comparing these charts on London smallpox deaths and British life expectancy we see that neither smallpox deaths or life expectancy dramatically deviated from their averages following the wider adoption of variolation in 1722.</p><p>But can we say something about the impact of Jenner&#x2019;s vaccination on life expectancy?&#xA0;The high case fatality rate of approximately 30 percent (for the variola major virus strand) meant that smallpox shortened the lives of many. Since the virus <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox#smallpox-endemic-characterisation">predominantly affected children</a> during endemic periods, smallpox deaths are likely to have had a disproportionate impact on average life expectancy.</p><p>The chart visualizes Sweden&#x2019;s life expectancy (in red) and deaths from smallpox (in blue) from 1774 to 1900. Large-scale smallpox outbreaks were documented for the years 1779, 1784, 1789, 1795 and 1800. These years exactly coincide with sharp declines in life expectancy, implying that smallpox endemicity did have a substantial effect on life expectancy. Furthermore, while the available data did not show a clear decline in smallpox deaths after the introduction of inoculation in Britain, they do show dramatic declines in mortality in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-in-london" target="_blank">London</a> as well as in Sweden (below) from 1800 onwards. Once smallpox mortality fell at the turn of the eighteenth to nineteenth century, life expectancy in Sweden for the first time was put on an upwards trending trajectory.</p><p>Overall, the impact of inoculation on life expectancy remains uncertain. Jenner&#x2019;s vaccine appears to have had a notable impact on increased life expectancy but this, to our knowledge, has not been studied in significant detail.<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sweden-life-expectancy-smallpox-deaths" class="grapherPreview">

The diseases shared similar symptoms (rashes) even though syphilis was caused by spirochaete bacteria and smallpox by the variola virus. Syphilis had already been known as variola, so smallpox became known as&#xA0;<em>la petite v&#xE9;role</em>. Petite is French for small so the disease became known as smallpox in English.</p><p>The name of the variola virus, in turn, can be derived from the Latin words <em>varus</em> (pimple) or <em>varius</em> (changing color) which derive from smallpox&#x2019;s symptoms described above.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a></p><p><strong>The variola virus family tree</strong><br>The variola virus is a member of the so-called orthopoxvirus family, whose other members are the vaccinia, cowpox and monkeypox viruses.<a id="ref-39" class="ref" href="#note-39"><sup>39</sup></a></p><p> This is important as Jenner&#x2019;s vaccine used the cowpox virus, a much milder and not lethal disease, to protect humans against smallpox. The variola virus is the family&#x2019;s only virus that exclusively infects humans.</p><p>The variola virus consists of two strands, known as the variola<em> major</em> and variola<em> minor</em> viruses. Infections of the variola major strand led to a patient&#x2019;s death in approximately 30% of cases, whereas the variola minor virus proved lethal in only less 1% of infections.<a id="ref-40" class="ref" href="#note-40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="standard-epidemiological-definitions"><a class="deep-link" href="#standard-epidemiological-definitions"></a>Standard epidemiological definitions</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p><strong>Eradication</strong> is the &#x201C;permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts&#x201D;.<a id="ref-41" class="ref" href="#note-41"><sup>41</sup></a></p><p><strong>Elimination</strong> refers to the &#x201C;reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographic area as a result of deliberate efforts.&#x201D; A disease can be eliminated from a specific region without being eradicated.<a id="ref-42" class="ref" href="#note-42"><sup>42</sup></a></p><p><strong>Infectious Diseases</strong>&#xA0;are &#x201C;disease[s] caused by the entrance into the body of organisms (as bacteria, protozoans, fungi, or viruses) which grow and multiply there&#x201D;.<a id="ref-43" class="ref" href="#note-43"><sup>43</sup></a></p><p><strong>Variolation</strong> refers to the deliberate transmission of viral matter, for example by inserting material from an infected person&#x2019;s skin underneath a healthy person&#x2019;s skin.<a id="ref-44" class="ref" href="#note-44"><sup>44</sup></a></p><p><strong>Endemic</strong> refers to the constant presence [&#x2026;] of a disease in a population within a geographic area.<a id="ref-45" class="ref" href="#note-45"><sup>45</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="smallpox-endemic-characterisation"><a class="deep-link" href="#smallpox-endemic-characterisation"></a>Smallpox endemic characterisation</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p><strong>Endemic vs. non-endemic populations</strong><br>The severity and most common age group for smallpox infections was dependent on whether the virus was endemic in a population. If a population had never been exposed to smallpox before, all age groups were vulnerable to infection, meaning outbreaks led to high case and death rates across the population. McMillan (2016)<a id="ref-46" class="ref" href="#note-46"><sup>46</sup></a></p><p> terms this a &#x2018;virgin soil epidemic&#x2019;, i.e. when a disease touches &#x201C;soil&#x201D; it has never touched before. The most prominent example of smallpox attacking an unprotected and never-exposed population in history is the introduction of the variola virus in North America by British colonialists. Data on the deaths of Native American tribes suffered were unfortunately not collected at the time but available sources agree that tribes were substantially decimated.<a id="ref-47" class="ref" href="#note-47"><sup>47</sup></a></p><p><strong>Regularity and severity</strong><br>In an endemic population, on the other hand, smallpox outbreaks with large numbers of cases and deaths usually occurred only every two to four years. In the periods between large outbreaks, the disease would persist at lower levels of incidence (with lower numbers of cases and deaths).</p><p>Such a pattern is common among viral diseases in an endemic population: by the time the virus had infected a population, an outbreak either engendered immunity or death, so a renewed outbreak in a subsequent year would infect fewer people.<a id="ref-48" class="ref" href="#note-48"><sup>48</sup></a></p><p>&#xA0;These cyclical outbreaks can be observed in the volatile pattern of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-in-london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smallpox share in London deaths</a> and also the&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-per-1000-population" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smallpox death rates across Europe</a>.<br><br><strong>Age profile of patients</strong><br>Smallpox could infect people of any age. However, when the virus was endemic in a society (uninterrupted transmission without depending on re-introduction from elsewhere), it mainly infected children. Adults in an endemic population would have been infected with the virus at an earlier stage in their lives already and since the only two possible outcomes of an infection were death or survival and life-long immunity, the virus could only infect and be transmitted by individuals that had never been exposed before: children.</p><p>In 17th century Britain, this led to children not being considered full members of the family until they had survived their smallpox infection. At the time, the British had not yet come up with a protection against smallpox so children were almost guaranteed to fall prey to an infection and families could do nothing but watch the infection run its course and hope the child would survive.<a id="ref-49" class="ref" href="#note-49"><sup>49</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="why-are-there-differences-between-reported-and-estimated-cases"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-are-there-differences-between-reported-and-estimated-cases"></a>Why are there differences between reported and estimated cases?</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Three main reasons are responsible for the huge differences between&#xA0;<em>reported</em> and the&#xA0;<em>estimated&#xA0;</em>(thought to be closer to the truth) number of cases and deaths due to smallpox. First, many infections and deaths were not recorded simply because the monitoring public health system was dysfunctional and that was predominantly the case in developing countries where the disease burden was highest. Fenner et al. (1988) write:&#xA0;&#x201C;It is clear that the reporting of cases of smallpox was the most efficient in countries in which the health services were well developed, which was usually where the disease was least common. It was very inefficient elsewhere.&#x201D;<a id="ref-50" class="ref" href="#note-50"><sup>50</sup></a></p><p>Second, classifying deaths posed another challenge. For instance if smallpox patients had already been suffering from pneumonia or even just a flu when becoming infected with smallpox and then died, it is unclear whether smallpox or pneumonia or the flu were the cause of death. Had a patient survived the smallpox infection if (s)he had not already been weakened by another disease, this creates a major challenge in classifying the cause of deaths which is likely to have further diminished the number of smallpox cases and deaths actually reported and recorded.</p><p>Third, some anecdotes suggest that some smallpox outbreaks were deliberately kept secret.<a id="ref-51" class="ref" href="#note-51"><sup>51</sup></a></p><p> Razzell (1977) writes in his book about&#xA0;British market towns: &#x201C;Many tradesmen in market towns may have suppressed information about smallpox in their families and certainly the townspeople as a whole were very anxious to avoid advertising the presence of smallpox in their own town so as to avoid frightening country people from the surrounding area &#x2013; there are many examples of markets being ruined for more than a year because of the presence of smallpox.&#x201D;<a id="ref-52" class="ref" href="#note-52"><sup>52</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="extent-of-reporting-discrepancy"><a class="deep-link" href="#extent-of-reporting-discrepancy"></a>Extent of reporting discrepancy</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The World Health Assembly was aware of the underreporting and therefore attempted to correct the number of reported smallpox cases upward for the years 1959 to 1966, just before the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program was launched. The chart illustrates that the corrections were highest for 1965, where the originally reported smallpox cases only amounted to 64,000 cases which was corrected to almost double its value, 112,000 cases.</p><p>Many sources suggest, however, that even these corrections were small in comparison to what the actual extent of smallpox&#x2019;s disease burden was. Fenner et al. (1988) write &#x201C;it is not unreasonable to regard the official figures reported to WHO as representing only 1-2 percent of the true incidence &#x2013; probably nearer 1 percent for the years before the initiation of the global eradication programme. In the early 1950s, 150 years after the introduction of vaccination, there were probably some 50 million cases of smallpox in the world each year, a figure which had fallen to perhaps 10-15 million by 1967.&#x201D;<a id="ref-53" class="ref" href="#note-53"><sup>53</sup></a></p><p> These figures are also mentioned in the final report by the WHO that confirmed smallpox&#x2019;s eradication, along with the disease still causing approximately 2 million deaths in 1967.<a id="ref-54" class="ref" href="#note-54"><sup>54</sup></a></p><p> Henderson (1976) adds that the <em>global</em> cases numbers reported to the WHO in 1967 probably were the number of infections taking place in northern Nigeria alone.<a id="ref-55" class="ref" href="#note-55"><sup>55</sup></a></p><p>In 1973, the World Health Organization conducted a thorough search for smallpox cases in line with its ring vaccination strategy in India: in a state that had reported approximately 500 cases a week the search team found 10,000 cases.<a id="ref-56" class="ref" href="#note-56"><sup>56</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-discrepancy-between-the-reported-and-actual-number-of-global-smallpox-cases" class="grapherPreview">

Ehreth (2003) estimates that the savings from forgone smallpox deaths and vaccination costs amount to $2 billion per year globally. However it is not clear to us how the author arrived at these estimates.</p>



<p>CGD (undated) suggest that the US is saving its contributions to the smallpox campaign every 26 days. We were again not able to find the calculation that would back up this claim.</p>

<p>Assuming that the estimate for the mid-1990s provides a midpoint estimate for the period since 1980 and therefore multiplying the 5 million per year estimate by the number of years between 1980 and 2018 means that since the eradication of the disease 190 million people’s lives were saved.</p>
