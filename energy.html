<section><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Access to energy is a key pillar for human wellbeing, economic development and poverty alleviation. Ensuring everyone has sufficient access is an ongoing and pressing challenge for global development.</p><p>However, our energy systems also have important environmental impacts. Historical and current energy systems are dominated by fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) which produce <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other greenhouse gases</a>&#x2013; the fundamental driver of global climate change.&#xA0;If we are to meet our global climate targets and avoid dangerous climate change, the world needs a significant and concerted transition in its energy sources.</p><p>Balancing the challenge between development and environment therefore provides us with an ultimate goal of ensuring everyone has access to enough sustainable energy to maintain a high standard of living.</p><p>In this entry we&#xA0;attempt to cover the fundamental pillars we need to understand global and regional energy systems: their evolution through time in terms of consumption, relative sources, and trade; progress in global energy access and our transition towards low-carbon sources; and crucially the main development, economic and health drivers behind the energy choices we make. It is intended to provide a fundamental background to the macro-trends in our historical and current energy systems, with key learnings on how we can use this understanding to shape pathways towards a sustainable future.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="block-wrapper" data-reactroot><div data-variation="full-width" class="wp-block-owid-additional-information"><h3 id="all-our-charts-on-energy"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="angle-right" class="svg-inline--fa fa-angle-right fa-w-8 " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M224.3 273l-136 136c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.6-22.6c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l96.4-96.4-96.4-96.4c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L54.3 103c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l136 136c9.5 9.4 9.5 24.6.1 34z"/></svg>All our charts on Energy</h3><div style="height:0;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" class="rah-static rah-static--height-zero"><div style="transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;-webkit-transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;opacity:0"><div class="content">

In the chart we see primary energy consumption from 1965-2015 aggregated by continental regions. Note that this dataset only includes commercially-traded fuels (coal, oil and gas), nuclear, and modern renewables. This means traditional biofuels are not included; as a result, figures are likely to be a small underestimate for regions (predominantly Africa and developing Asia) where populations still strongly rely on traditional biomass as a primary fuel source.</p><p>In 1965 the bulk of total energy was consumed&#xA0;North America, Europe and Eurasia- collectively, they accounted for more than 80 percent of global energy consumption. Although energy consumption has increased in these regions since the 1960s, their relative share of the total has declined significantly. Consumption across the rest of the world has been increasing, most dramatically in the Asia Pacific where the total consumption increased more than 12-fold over this period.</p><p>As a result, in 2015 Asia Pacific was by far the largest regional consumer with 42 percent- this was about the same as North America, Europe and Eurasia combined (at 43 percent).

In the chart we see long-term trends in energy transitions in Italy; this figure has been developed based on data from Gales et al. (2007).<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p> Similar data across a range of countries in Europe and the Americas has been made available at the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~histecon/energyhistory/energydata_beta.html" target="_blank">Energy History project</a> at the Joint Center for History and Economics, Harvard University and University of Cambridge you can explore these trends using the &#x201C;change country&#x201D; function in the chart.</p><p>These trends provide an additional energy dimension: human and animal power. The inclusion of muscle, food for labour and animal feed reminds us of the important earlier transition in these economies from human and animal labour to industrialised energy production.&#xA0;In high-income countries, the uptake of fossil fuels- and later, the integration of renewable and nuclear technologies- has effectively eliminated the use of human or animal labour. In some low-to-middle income nations, the contribution of a human labour force (especially in agricultural and manufacturing sectors) is still significant, but continuing to progress&#xA0;through the composition shifts we see in the figures.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/long-term-energy-transitions-in-europe-and-the-americas" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="per-capita-energy-consumption"><a class="deep-link" href="#per-capita-energy-consumption"></a>Per capita energy consumption</h2><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Here we see trends in per capita energy use from 1960-2014; this is inclusive of all dimensions of energy (electricity plus transport and heating), not exclusively electricity (with energy normalised kilowatt-hour equivalents per year). There are several important points to note. Firstly, global average per capita energy consumption has been consistently increasing; between 1970-2014, average consumption has increased by approximately 45 percent.</p><p>This growth in per capita energy consumption does, however, vary significantly between countries and regions. Most of the growth in per capita energy consumption over the last few decades has been driven by increased consumption in transitioning middle-income (and to a lesser extent, low income countries). In the chart we see a significant increase in consumption&#xA0;in transitioning BRICS economies (China, India and Brazil in particular); China&#x2019;s per capita use has grown by nearly 250 percent since 2000; India by more than 50 percent; and Brazil by 38 percent.</p><p>Whilst global energy growth is growing from developing economies, the trend for many high-income nations is a notable decline. As we see in exemplar trends from the UK and US, the growth we are currently seeing in transitioning economies ended for many high-income nations by over the 1970-80s period. Both the US and UK peaked in terms of per capita energy consumption in the 1970s, plateauing for several decades until the early 2000s. Since then, we see a reduction in consumption; since 2000, UK usage has decreased by 20-25 percent.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite this decline in high-income countries, large global inequalities still exist. The average US citizen still consumes more than ten times the energy of the average Indian, 4-5 times that of a Brazilian, and three times more than China.

<section><h2 id="energy-intensity-of-economies"><a class="deep-link" href="#energy-intensity-of-economies"></a>Energy intensity of economies</h2><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>If we want to continue growing economically, increasing prosperity, and working towards poverty&#xA0;elimination (which most countries and individuals do) whilst efficiently managing energy resources (and reducing&#xA0;greenhouse gas emissions), &#x2018;energy intensity&#x2019; becomes an important metric for tracking progress. Energy intensity measures the quantity of energy needed to produce one unit of gross domestic product (GDP) growth. It&#x2019;s typically measured in kilowatt-hours of energy needed to produce one dollar of growth (kWh per dollar). It is essentially a measure of the energy efficiency of economies; we want to achieve economic growth with as low an energy input as possible.</p><p>In the chart we show how the energy intensity of economies have changed since 1990 (measured in kWh per 2011 international-$). Here, we see a distinct downward trend- at the global level, as well as across all income-level brackets. Note that you can view trends for individual countries on the interactive chart, and get a global overview using the &#x2018;map&#x2019; tab.</p><p>In 1990, as a global average, it took 2.1 kWh of energy to produce one international dollar of economic output; in 2014 this had&#xA0;declined to 1.5kWh. This represents a 30 percent reduction. Efficiency gains have been seen across all income-levels. High-income economies typically have the lowest energy-intensity (i.e. they are more energy efficient per unit of economic output), and a large efficiency gap exists between lowest-income nations and the rest of the world. The relative energy intensity of economies is strongly linked to their composition, and more specifically the share of services versus industry and manufacturing output. The links between energy intensity and economy composition are discussed <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources/#transitioning-economies-and-declining-energy-intensity">later in this entry</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-intensity-of-economies" class="grapherPreview">

Both of these options&#xA0;produce&#xA0;very low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of energy compared with fossil fuels. We call this process of transitioning from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources &#x2018;decarbonisation&#x2019;.</p><p>In the first section of this entry, we saw that our progress in decarbonising our total energy system (including transport, heat and electricity) has been slow. Fossil fuels are still the dominant energy source. If we focus on our electricity sector in particular, are we performing any better?<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>Our progress over the last decade tells an interesting story which we have covered in its own <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-renewables-are-growing-but-are-only-managing-to-offset-a-decline-in-nuclear-production/">blog post</a>. These trends&#xA0;can be explained&#xA0;in the four charts which map the share of renewable, nuclear and fossil fuel sources in global electricity production. As a brief summary: over the last decade (2005-2015) the share of renewables in our electricity mix has increased by approximately 5-6 percent. This is good news. However, over this same period, the share from nuclear production has decreased by almost exactly the same amount (5-6 percent).</p><p>Overall, this means that our total share of low-carbon electricity production is almost exactly the same as a decade ago (as shown in the chart). In fact, if we compare the&#xA0;share of electricity produced by low-carbon sources (renewables and nuclear) in 2015 to that of&#xA0;1990 , we see that it has dropped by around three percent. Progress on electricity decarbonisation has been stalled over the last decade as a result of a growing aversion to nuclear energy.</p><p>The final chart provides a breakdown of fossil fuel sources in our electricity mix. Since 2005, natural gas and coal have increased their share by one and two percent, respectively whereas the contribution from oil has declined by two percent. Nonetheless, overall, the relative mix of electricity sources has changed very little over the&#xA0;last few decades.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-side-by-side"><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/renewable-electricity-electricity-production" class="grapherPreview">

The other important factor in energy trade is domestic levels of energy consumption. If you are a country rich in resources but also have high domestic levels of consumption, you may have little energy left to export. Similarly, if a country has low levels of energy consumption, if may still be a net exporter of energy despite have comparatively low levels of natural resources. Other influences on energy trade may be geopolitical: for example, some countries may want to converse fuel resources to maintain levels of energy security into the future.</p><p>In the two charts we have graphed energy imports and exports, both by income level and by region. Note that you can also manually select countries to compare. Here we have measured energy imports and exports as a percentage of domestic energy use, where a positive percentage indicates a country or region is a net&#xA0;<em>importer</em> of energy, and negative is a net&#xA0;<em>exporter</em>. For example, collectively high-income nations in 2014 imported nearly five percent of consumed energy.</p><p>In terms of income level, we see that there is a distinct flow of energy resources from low, middle and upper middle income to high-income nations (with the exception of lower middle income). On a continental basis, we see the dominance of energy exports from the Middle East &amp; North Africa (being a net exporter of 127 percent of its consumption levels). Interestingly, Sub-Saharan Africa is also a net exporter of energy (despite having low levels of coal reserves and only moderate levels of oil and gas)- this is most likely a result of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources/#per-capita-energy-consumption">low levels of domestic consumption</a>. North America and Europe &amp; Central Asia reach approximately energy parity (effectively balancing consumption with trade). South Asia is a net importer of energy, importing approximately one-third of its energy consumption.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-side-by-side"><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-imports-and-exports-energy-use?country=High%20income+Low%20income+Lower%20middle%20income+Middle%20income+Upper%20middle%20income" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="investment-in-renewable-technologies"><a class="deep-link" href="#investment-in-renewable-technologies"></a>Investment in renewable technologies</h2><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Shifting our energy systems away from fossil fuels towards renewable technologies will require significant financial&#xA0;investment. But how much are we really investing in the sector, and how is this finance distributed across the world?</p><p>In the graph we see global investments in renewable technologies from 2004 to 2015 (measured in billion USD per year). In 2004, the world invested 47 billion USD. By 2015, this had increased to 286 billion USD, an increase of more than 600 percent. Investment has grown across all regions, but at significantly different rates. Note that you can use the &#x2018;absolute/relative&#x2019; toggle on the chart to compare regions on relative terms.&#xA0;Growth has been greatest in China, increasing from 3&#xA0;billion USD in 2004 to 103 billion USD by 2015 (an increase of 3400%). China is now the largest single investor in renewable technologies, investing approximately the same as the United States, Europe and India combined.</p><p>Combining Chinese and Indian investment with its neighbours, Asia &amp; Oceania is the largest continental investor. Europe&#x2019;s investment has been through a significant growth-peak-reduction trend, peaking in 2011 at 123 billion USD before declining to 49 billion USD in 2015. Investment in the Middle East &amp; Africa remains relatively small, but has shown significant growth over the last ten years (after investing only 0.5 billion USD in 2004).</p><p>Levels of absolute investment tell an important story, but are disadvantaged by the fact that they take no account of the size of investments relative to a country&#x2019;s economy. We might expect that the largest economies would also be the largest investors. If we want to assess which countries are making a fair &#x2018;contribution&#x2019; or &#x2018;share&#x2019; to investment in clean energy, it is useful to&#xA0;assess investment contributions as a percentage of a country&#x2019;s gross domestic product (GDP). We have calculated this (as a percentage of GDP) and plotted&#xA0;it for the largest single-country investors in one of the charts.</p><p>This tells a slightly different story. Most countries invest less than one percent of GDP in renewable technologies (with the exception of South Africa and Chile, which make an impressive contribution at 1.4 percent). When normalised to GDP, China remains one of the largest investors, at 0.9 percent. Interestingly, despite being the second largest investor in absolute terms, the United States invested only 0.1 percent of its GDP in 2015.</p><p>Indeed, when it comes to relative contributors to renewable energy, low-to-middle income transitioning economies typically invest more than high-income nations. This may be partly explained by the fact that these nations are likely to be investing a higher percentage of their GDP into energy provision and expansion overall (whereas high-income nations typically have well-established energy systems). Nonetheless, most high-income nations have set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets in their commitments to&#xA0;the Paris climate agreement.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p> Achieving these targets will require significant investments in low-carbon technologies.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-side-by-side"><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/renewable-energy-investment?country=Americas%20(excl.%20US%20and%20Brazil)+Asia%20and%20Oceania%20(excl.%20China%20and%20India)+BRA+CHN+Europe+IND+Middle%20East%20and%20Africa+United%20States%20of%20America" class="grapherPreview">

The potential for energy to improve living standards, whether through the freeing of time from household chores (for example, washing clothes or cooking); increased productivity; improved healthcare and education services; or digital connections to local, regional and global networks.</p><p>The link between energy consumption and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth">economic growth</a> has been a topic of wide discussion. A large number of studies have attempted to derive the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, however no clear consensus has emerged.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p> This can be partly attributed to the fact that the link between energy and prosperity is not always unidirectional. Gaining access to electricity and other energy sources may provide an initial increase in GDP, but having higher GDP may in turn drive higher energy consumption. Additionally, progress in development outcomes can be complex: a number of parameters may be improving at the same time. If, for example, energy access and consumption, nutrition, education, health, and sanitation are all improving simultaneously (and having complex relationships with one another), it can be hard to directly attribute improvement in living standards back to a single parameter.</p><p>Chontanawat et al. (2008) carried out&#xA0;a systematic study across 100 countries to try to reach a common consensus on the energy-GDP link.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p> Akinlo (2008) did similarly across 11 Sub-Sahara African countries to define a common relationship.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p> Neither found a causal relationship which was true in all contexts. For some countries, the relationship was unidirectonal (energy consumption was a direct and long-term driver of economic growth), others are bidirectional; some are cointegrated with other factors; and for some there was actually no clear link between the two. Nonetheless, for most countries, there is an important relationship between energy and prosperity. However, the exact dynamics of each is complex and context-dependent.</p><p>What does our data suggest of this link between the two? In the chart we have plotted per capita energy consumption (on the y-axis) versus per capita GDP (PPP-adjusted) (on the x-axis) for the year 2015. Indeed, we see a strong trend: typically the higher a country&#x2019;s average income, the more energy it consumes. In our second chart we present the percentage of the population with access to electricity (y-axis) versus GDP per capita (x-axis). If we press play and watch how these trends evolve through time, we see a similar trend: both electricity access and prosperity increase for most countries through time. However, in both of these visualisations,&#xA0;it&#x2019;s challenging to differentiate how much of this trend can be explained by energy-led growth, and how much is a result of growth-led energy consumption.</p><p>In our final chart we have plotted the relationship between per capita energy consumption (y-axis) and the share of the population in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/">extreme poverty</a> (x-axis). In general, we see a trend of poverty alleviation with higher energy consumption levels. However, this does not necessarily hold as a direct relationship for all countries.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-side-by-side"><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-use-per-capita-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="what-drives-choices-of-energy-sources"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-drives-choices-of-energy-sources"></a>What drives choices of energy sources?</h2><h3 id="relative-cost-of-energy-sources"><a class="deep-link" href="#relative-cost-of-energy-sources"></a>Relative cost of energy sources</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Prices can&#xA0;strongly influence our choice of energy sources. In this regard, it is the&#xA0;<em>relative</em> cost between sources which is important. This is true in higher-income countries (we want low energy bills), but is increasingly important in low and middle-income economies. For&#xA0;many countries, increasing the share of the&#xA0;population with access to electricity and energy resources is a key priority, and to do so, low-cost energy is essential.</p><p>How do we compare the relative cost of energy? The dominant energy source in the transport sector is liquid fuels (diesel and gasoline) for which relative costs are less important than changes in price through time. Let&#x2019;s therefore focus on the relative costs of energy sources in the electricity sector.</p><p>To do this, we compare costs based on what we call the &#x2018;levelised cost of electricity&#x2019; (LCOE). The LCOE attempts to provide a consistent comparison of electricity costs across sources but taking the full life-cycle costs into account. It is calculated by dividing the average total cost to build then operate (i.e. both capital and operating costs) an energy asset (for example a coal-fired power station, a wind farm, or solar panel) by the total energy output of that asset over its lifetime. This gives us a measure of the average total cost per unit of electricity produced. Measuring sources on this consistent basis attempts to account for the fact that resources vary in terms of their capital and operating costs (for example, solar PV may have higher capital costs, but lower operating costs relative to coal over time). Note that this cost of energy production has an obvious impact on electricity prices for the consumer: the LCOE represents the minimum cost producers would have to charge consumers in order to break-even over the lifetime of the energy project.</p><p>To be truly competitive, renewable technologies will have to be cost-competitive with fossil fuel sources. In the chart, sourced from IRENA&#x2019;s latest Rethinking Energy report, we see the LCOE (measured in 2016 USD per megawatt-hour of electricity produced) across the range of renewable technologies in 2010, and in 2016.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>It&#x2019;s important to acknowledge that the relative costs of energy are context-dependent and vary across the world. For example, the relative cost of solar PV is likely to be lower in lower latitude countries than at high-latitudes because they will produce more energy of their lifetime. This can produce very different LCOE figures by region (and indeed the country-specific LCOE charts can vary significantly). For our global chart, this range of costs is represented as vertical bars for each technology. The white line in each represents the global weighted average cost per technology.</p><p>Similarly, the cost of fossil fuels can very depending on the fuel quality, ease of extraction and regional resources. The average range of fossil fuel costs is shown as the grey horizontal block.</p><p>What we see is that in terms of the 2016 weighted average cost, most renewable technologies are within a competitive range of fossil fuels. The key exception to this is solar thermal which remains about twice as expensive (although is falling). Hydropower, with the exception of traditional biomass, is our oldest and well-established renewable source: this is reflected in its low price (which can undercut even the cheapest fossil fuel sources). Note however that although the weighted average of most sources is competitive with the average fossil fuel cost, the wide range of potential costs means that this is not true for all countries. This is why the selection of particular technologies need to be considered on a local, context-specific basis.</p><p>If we consider how the average cost of technologies changed from 2010-16, we see that both solar PV (and to a lesser extent, solar thermal) dropped substantially. This cost reduction in solar PV has been dramatic over the past few decades, as shown in the chart. The price of solar PV modules has fallen more than 100-fold since 1976. On average, the technology has had a learning rate of 22 percent; this means that the cost falls by 22 percent for every doubling in solar PV capacity (although progress has not necessarily been constant over this period).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) 2010 and 2016<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/05/LCOE-2010-2016-750x396.jpg" alt="Lcoe 2010 2016" class="wp-image-11924" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/05/LCOE-2010-2016-750x396.jpg 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/05/LCOE-2010-2016-150x79.jpg 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/05/LCOE-2010-2016-400x211.jpg 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/05/LCOE-2010-2016-768x405.jpg 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/05/LCOE-2010-2016.jpg 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/05/LCOE-2010-2016.jpg"></figure></div><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices-vs-cumulative-capacity" class="grapherPreview">

This finding transformed human development: for most of history, living conditions across the world were equally poor. This began to change, rapidly, once we learnt how to use coal, oil, and gas. In more recent years, we have also gained access to modern <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy">renewables</a> and nuclear power.</p><p>The increasing availability of cheap energy has been integral to the progress we&#x2019;ve seen over the past few centuries. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-access">Energy access</a> is one of the fundamental driving forces of development. The United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/">says</a> that &#x201C;energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today.&#x201D;</p><p>But energy production has downsides as well as benefits. There are three main categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Air pollution</strong>: An estimated <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution#air-pollution-is-one-of-the-world-s-leading-risk-factors-for-death">five million people</a> die prematurely every year as a result of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution">air pollution</a>; fossil fuels and biomass burning are responsible for most of those deaths.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Accidents</strong>: As well as deaths caused by the byproducts of energy production, people die in accidents in supply chains, whether in the mining of coal, uranium or rare metals; oil and gas extraction; the transport of raw materials and infrastructure; construction; or their deployment.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Greenhouse gas emissions</strong>: Perhaps the most widely discussed downside is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gases</a> emitted by energy production, which are a key driver of climate change.&#xA0;</li></ul><p>All energy sources have negative effects. But they differ enormously in the size of those effects. That difference can be easily summed up: by all metrics, fossil fuels are the dirtiest and most dangerous, while nuclear and modern renewable energy sources are vastly safer and cleaner. </p><p>From the perspectives of both human health and climate change, it matters less whether we use nuclear power or renewable energy, and more that we change to one or both of them rather than fossil fuels.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="nuclear-power-is-far-far-safer-than-fossil-fuels-contrary-to-public-belief"><a class="deep-link" href="#nuclear-power-is-far-far-safer-than-fossil-fuels-contrary-to-public-belief"></a>Nuclear power is far, far safer than fossil fuels, contrary to public belief</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>For most of the past 50 years, our energy systems have been dominated by fossil fuels, traditional biomass, hydropower and nuclear energy.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>In the future we expect renewable energy sources to contribute a rising share of total energy, but before we take a closer look at how renewables compare,&#xA0; let&#x2019;s first see how fossil fuels stack up against nuclear energy in terms of safety.</p><p>Anil Markandya and Paul Wilkinson (2007) published an analysis in the medical journal <em>The Lancet, </em>which compared the death rates from the major energy sources.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> In this study they considered deaths from accidents, such as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, occupational accidents in mining or power plant operations, and premature deaths from air pollution.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a>&#xA0;</p><p>This study was published in 2007, before the 2011 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster</a> in Japan. You might assume that the figures from this analysis therefore understate the death toll from nuclear energy, but in fact the opposite is true. Later in this article we look at a more recent study on the safety of low-carbon energy sources, published in 2016 which includes Fukushima impacts, and in fact reports a <em>lower</em> death rate than Markandya and Wilkinson (2007).<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> There were no direct deaths from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The official death toll was 573 people, all of which were premature deaths from evacuation and displacement of populations in the surrounding area.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 2018, the Japanese government <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45423575">reported</a> that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event.</p><p>To compare the safety of different energy sources, the researchers compared the number of deaths per unit of energy that is produced by them.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> In the visualization we see the safety comparison of fossil fuels, nuclear and biomass, measured as the number of deaths per terawatt-hour of energy production.

To be clear: the figures in this analysis was based on energy production in Europe where anti-pollution regulation and technologies are already well ahead of many countries in the world;&#xA0; in this case the death rate from fossil fuels may even be understated.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s put this into the context of the 27,000 Europeans that one terawatt-hour would provide for.

It may even be the case that this figure is an overestimate &#x2013; later in the article we look at a more recent analysis of nuclear safety which suggests this is closer to one death every 100 years.</p><p>Fossil fuels have therefore killed many more people than nuclear energy.&#xA0;</p><p>In many countries, however, public opinion on nuclear energy <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-opposition-to-nuclear-energy-production">is very negative</a> and, as a consequence, policy decisions have in some places turned harshly against it.&#xA0;</p><p>In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany announced plans to phase out nuclear power generation: over the period from 2011 to 2017 it shut down 10 of its 17 nuclear facilities, and plans to close the remaining reactors in 2022.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>These policy decisions can cost lives. In a study published in the journal <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>, Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen (2013) reversed the conventional question of &#x2018;how many people have died from nuclear power?&#x2019; into &#x2018;how many lives has nuclear power <em>saved</em>?&#x2019;.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> They analysed how many additional people would have died over the period from 1971 to 2009 if nuclear energy had been replaced by fossil fuels. The human cost would have depended on the mix of fossil fuels used to replace nuclear &#x2013; more would have died if more coal was used than oil or gas &#x2013; but they estimate an average figure of two million lives saved.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p><p>Replacing nuclear energy with fossil fuels kills people. This is likely to be the case in the recent example of Germany. Most of Germany&#x2019;s energy deficit from scrapping nuclear was filled by increased coal production &#x2013; the most polluting source with the largest health impacts. Analysis by Stephen Jarvis, Olivier Deschenes, and Akshaya Jha (2020) estimates that Germany&#x2019;s nuclear phase-out has come at the cost of more than 1,100 additional deaths each year as a result of air pollution.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a> Its plans to make its energy systems safer have done exactly the opposite.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh" class="grapherPreview">

<p>The analysis of Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) and Sovacool et al. (2016) report different death rates for biomass and nuclear. Why do these estimates vary? <br><br><strong>Biomass: </strong>The difference between the biomass death rate figures is simple to explain: Markandya &amp; Wilkinson include the health impacts of air pollution. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution">Indoor air pollution</a>, which results from the burning of solid fuels (including wood, dung and other biomass sources) for cooking and heating in households <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution#indoor-air-pollution-is-one-of-the-leading-risk-factors-for-premature-death">kills 1.6 million people</a> every year, mainly in lower-income countries. Markandya &amp; Wilkinson (2007) focus their analysis in Europe where biomass energy is produced in state-of-the-art (in the year 2007, at least) facilities that maintain EU environmental standards. These health impacts are much lower than for indoor air pollution typical of lower-income countries, but can still be a significant contributor to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution">outdoor air pollution</a>. The inclusion of air pollution deaths is why their estimated death rates are much higher.</p>



<p>In contrast, Sovacool et al. (2016) do not include air pollution estimates, and instead focus on deaths from accidents at biomass production facilities (such as explosions or fires) and their supply chains. As a result, total death rate figures are much lower.</p>



<p><strong>Nuclear: </strong>there are two key points to differentiate in the estimates of nuclear energy safety. The first is the period which the studies cover. Analysis by Markandya &amp; Wilkinson (2007) predates the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and therefore does not include this accident in its estimates. This fact, however, does not fully explain why the two studies differ: we might assume the inclusion of the Fukushima disaster would increase death rates but in fact the estimates of Sovacool et al. (2016) are <em>lower</em>.&#xA0;</p>



<p>The largest differentiator here is the period which the Sovacool et al. (2016) estimates cover. They report normalized death rates over the limited period from 1990 to 2013. This means the 1986 Chernobyl accident was not included. Sovacool et al. (2016) only include deaths from the Fukushima accident, with 573 attributed deaths. It is useful to note here that not all deaths were a direct result of the accident: for Fukushima, there were no direct deaths from the disaster; one confirmed death from radiation exposure; and the rest noted as premature deaths from evacuation and displacement of populations in the surrounding area.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>



<p>The deaths which occurred as a result of the nuclear disaster were the result of the <em>response</em> to the event, rather than the event itself.</p>



<p>Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) include estimated death tolls from distinct accidents (not including Fukushima) but also provide an estimate of deaths from occupational effects. They note that deaths: <br>&#x201C;<em>can arise from occupational effects (especially from mining), routine radiation during generation, decommissioning, reprocessing, low-level waste disposal, high-level waste disposal, and accidents. The data [&#x2026;] show occupational deaths of around 0&#xB7;019 per TWh, </em><strong><em>largely at the mining, milling, and generation stages</em></strong><em>. These numbers are small in the context of normal operations. For example, a normal reactor of the kind in operation in France would produce 5&#xB7;7 TWh a year. Hence, more than 10 years of operations would be needed before a single occupational death could be attributed to the plant. Likewise, numbers of deaths through cancer, severe hereditary effects, and non-fatal cancers caused by normal operations are extremely small.&#x201D;</em></p>



<p>The estimates of Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) are therefore higher than Sovacool et al. (2016) because they include the Chernobyl disaster, and assume additional occupational deaths at various stages of the nuclear supply chain. This methodology adopts the &#x2018;linear non-threshold&#x2019; (LNT) method, which assumes there is no minimum &#x2018;safe&#x2019; threshold of radiation exposure, and that cancer risk increases linearly from zero. Since the study&#x2019;s publication, the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has made clear that the LNT method represents a highly cautious approach, and likely overstates the number of potential cancer cases and deaths which result from low-level radiation exposure.<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>



<p>These estimates are therefore likely to be highly conservative. The LNT method, is however, still typically adopted in the development of radiation protection.</p>



<p>If we look at the case of the 2011 Fukushima disaster: the World Health Organization (WHO) Report published five years on, suggests very low risk of increased cancer deaths in Japan.<a id="ref-31" class="ref" href="#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a> In a review of the response and long-term health impacts of Fukushima, published by Michael Reich and Aya Goto in <em>The Lancet</em>, the authors note that: &#x201C;no one has died from radiation exposure, and the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation report in 2013 stated that substantial changes in future cancer statistics attributed to radiation exposure are not expected to be observed&#x201D;.<a id="ref-32" class="ref" href="#note-32"><sup>32</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-33" class="ref" href="#note-33"><sup>33</sup></a> These findings highlight the shift of consensus away from the historical linear non-threshold method, where it was assumed that even very low levels of exposure increased cancer risk.</p>

For technologies which have been developing rapidly – namely solar, wind and other renewables, production technologies and intensities have changed significantly since then, and will continue to change as energy systems decarbonize. Life-cycle figures for nuclear, solar, wind and hydropower have therefore been adopted by the more recent publication by Pehl et al.

Figures for oil have therefore been taken from Turconi et al. (2013). It reports emissions in kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per megawatt-hour. Emissions factors for all other technologies are consistent with results from the IPCC. The range it gives for oil is 530–900: I have here taken the midpoint estimate (715 kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq/MWh, which is also 715 gCO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh). </p>
