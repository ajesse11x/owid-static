<p>Since the invention of the smallpox vaccine, vaccines have greatly reduced the prevalence of diseases everywhere in the world. This research article explains which vaccines are available and where they are, what their impact on global health is, and how the world can make more progress against early death and disease with the help of vaccines.</p>

But how many lives vaccines have they saved? </p><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) suggests that vaccination prevents 2-3 million deaths each year.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, while we are certain that vaccines have saved millions of lives, calculating a precise number is impossible. Also the quoted number from the WHO is in important ways a very low estimate.</p><p>The counterfactual world, in which vaccines would have never been developed, would be so different that an estimate of the impact of vaccines is impossible. One example that makes this clear is to consider the impact of the smallpox vaccine: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox">Smallpox</a> was once an extremely common and deadly infectious disease, but it has been eradicated globally back in 1977 thanks to the vaccination against the disease. It is impossible to know exactly how many people would die of smallpox today if scientists had not developed the vaccine. Reasonable estimates are in the range of around 5 million lives per year, which implies that between 1980 and 2018 around 150 to 200 million lives have been saved.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> This makes clear why it is so difficult to estimate the number of lives saved every year and why the WHO estimate is rather low.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="how-vaccines-work-herd-immunity"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-vaccines-work-herd-immunity"></a>How vaccines work &amp; herd immunity</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The basic mechanism by which vaccines work is simple: Vaccines create immunity in an individual by introducing a weakened or killed form of the pathogen that make us ill &#x2013; such as bacteria or viruses &#x2013; or its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The vaccine induces acquired immunity&#xA0;so that when your body encounters the real disease-causing agent it is ready to mount a defense.</p><p>There is a collective social benefit in a high vaccination coverage. For most diseases, the greater the proportion of people who are immunized, the better protected is everyone in the population as the disease transmission can be reduced or stopped. Herd immunity is a community protection that is created when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, such that it less likely that the infectious disease spreads.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>Herd immunity provides a protective barrier, especially also for those who <em>cannot</em> be vaccinated. These include vulnerable groups such as babies too young to be vaccinated or immune-compromised children who are the first potential victims of low vaccination rates.</p><p>When a person is immune to a disease they can act as a barrier to slow down or prevent the transmission of disease to other people. When the number of people in a population that are immune against a disease is reached, such that a disease no longer persists in the population, this is called the <em>herd immunity threshold</em> (HIT). The table shows the HIT for several diseases. Measles and pertussis are highly contagious airborne diseases and a larger share of people need to be vaccinated to stop the transmission. Because of this these diseases have the highest HIT rates that need to be reached. For example, two doses of measles vaccination offers 99% protection, while in the absence of immunization, the lifetime risk of infection is nearly 100%.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Herd Immunity Thresholds of vaccine-preventable diseases<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></h6><div class="tableContainer"><table id="tablepress-77" class="tablepress tablepress-id-77">

An early form of vaccination was referred to as &#x2018;variolation&#x2019; or more broadly as &#x2018;inoculation&#x2019;. Practised for a long time in Asia, this was an ancient technique of deliberate <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox">smallpox</a> infection in which dried&#xA0;smallpox scabs were blown up the nose to infect the person with a form of the disease which was often milder. By the 1700s variolation had spread to Africa, India and the Ottoman Empire, followed by the UK and America, where the method of infection more frequently used was a puncture to the skin.</p><p>Variolation did work, but there were large risks. Those variolated could contract the more severe form of smallpox and die, and they could also transmit the disease to others.</p><p>In 1796 English physician Edward Jenner demonstrated another method of inoculation in which he relied on cowpox. Cowpox is a similar disease to smallpox and it had previously been observed that an infection with cowpox can protect against smallpox. Jenner conducted an experiment using matter from a cowpox lesion to inoculate his gardener&#x2019;s eight-year-old son James Phipps. Two months later Jenner exposed the boy to smallpox lesion matter&#xA0;and when Phipps did not develop smallpox he concluded that he was protected against the disease. Jenner called the procedure &#x2018;vaccination&#x2019; after &#x2018;vacca&#x2019; the Latin word for cow because of the origin of this first vaccination from the cowpox virus.</p><p>Following the findings of Jenner as the first scientific attempt to control disease by vaccination, the smallpox vaccine went through many iterations, with the newer vaccines produced by modern cell culture techniques (passing the virus through cell culture makes the vaccine safer). By the middle of the 20th century confidence grew that smallpox could be the first disease that humankind might be able to eradicate. In 1967 the WHO launched a <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">global eradication of smallpox program</a>. Mass vaccination of over 80% of a country&#x2019;s population ensued but people who were nomadic or lived in politically unstable regions posed particular problems. A number of innovations came in the development of foot-powered injector called the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">&#x201C;ped-o-jet&#x201D; and then the bifurcated needle</a>, which was efficient and cost-effective to use.</p><p>In order to reach large sections of population, epidemiologist <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">William Foege</a> developed Eradication Escalation (E2) to contain smallpox outbreaks during October (the seasonal low point of smallpox transmission where prevention of just few cases could stop a smallpox chain transmission). <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">Other obstacles faced</a> included forcibly vaccinating an Indian religious leader to convince his followers to be vaccinated, negotiation of ceasefires for vaccine transport in war-torn Nigeria, vaccinating in concentric rings around an outbreak, and cash bounties to reward the reporting of smallpox cases. Finally in 1977 the last case of naturally contracted smallpox was reported in Somalia, in Ali Maow Maalin, and in 1980 the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">WHO announced that smallpox had been eradicated</a>. We cover the history of smallpox, including the vaccination and eradication, in more detail in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox">smallpox</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="vaccine-innovation"><a class="deep-link" href="#vaccine-innovation"></a>Vaccine innovation</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The chart here shows a timeline of innovation in the development of vaccines. Each bar begins in the year in which the pathogenic agent was first linked to the disease and the bar ends in the year in which a vaccination against that pathogen was licensed in the US.</p><p>For some diseases there has been a relatively short timespan between when the infectious agent was linked to the disease and when a vaccine was developed. The quickest was 10 years for measles.

In this chart we plotted the survey responses that people gave when they were asked <em>&#x201C;How many of the world&#x2019;s 1-year old children today have been vaccinated against some disease?&#x201D;</em>. The correct answer was 85.8%; this is the share of 1-year olds that received the third dose of the combination vaccine that protects against Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (whooping cough).</p><p>But in all countries in which people were surveyed people were much too pessimistic about the global coverage. Americans think that only 35% of the world&#x2019;s children are vaccinated, the true coverage is 50 percentage points higher.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><p>In Japan people were even more pessimistic and thought that only 18% were vaccinated. As it is often the case in&#xA0;questions on global development we again see that people in poorer countries have a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wrong-about-the-world">more accurate view of the world</a>: in Kenya and Senegal people thought that vaccines reach around two thirds of all children in the world, but even these highest estimates are 20 percentage points too low.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>We hugely underestimate global vaccination coverage<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/08/Misperception-of-global-vaccination-coverage-404x550.png" alt="Misperception of global vaccination coverage" class="wp-image-20057" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/08/Misperception-of-global-vaccination-coverage-404x550.png 404w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/08/Misperception-of-global-vaccination-coverage-110x150.png 110w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/08/Misperception-of-global-vaccination-coverage-294x400.png 294w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/08/Misperception-of-global-vaccination-coverage-768x1046.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/08/Misperception-of-global-vaccination-coverage.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="people-s-view-on-vaccination-coverage-is-outdated-by-more-than-three-decades"><a class="deep-link" href="#people-s-view-on-vaccination-coverage-is-outdated-by-more-than-three-decades"></a>People&#x2019;s view on vaccination coverage is outdated by more than three decades</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The chart here illustrates how outdated people&#x2019;s answers are.

Only 66% of Japanese respondents thought vaccines were important for children to have &#x2013; very low in comparison to other countries. But few disagreed that vaccines were safe (only 8%) and disagreed that they&#x2019;re effective (only 3%). If few people thought they were unsafe and ineffective, why would support for vaccines be so low?</p><p>Many Japanese respondents did not answer either way. 28% answered &#x201C;neither agree nor disagree&#x201D; to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-neither-agrees-disagrees-vaccines-important">whether child vaccination is important</a>; 55% to the question regarding the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-neither-agree-disagree-vaccines-are-safe">safety of vaccines</a>; and one-third were undecided on their effectiveness. It&#x2019;s difficult here, without further questions, to fully interpret the opinions of those in this undecided category: maybe they had no opinion; or they thought vaccines could be safe or effective in some cases, but not all; or some vaccines were safe but others were not. With this data, it&#x2019;s impossible to fully understand their reasoning.</p><p>This stance was common across several other countries, as we see in the map.</p><p>While being undecided or divided is perhaps less concerning than denialism on the importance, safety and effectiveness of vaccination, it nonetheless suggests that many are unaware of the massive role vaccines have played in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#eradication-of-diseases-through-vaccination">eradicating diseases</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#diseases-preventable-through-vaccination">saving lives across the world</a>. The success story of vaccines is one we don&#x2019;t tell often enough.</p><p>It&#x2019;s also true that people in the &#x2018;neither&#x2019; group may be more likely to be convinced by arguments that are put forward by those who deny the safety, effectiveness and importance of vaccination.

Does it really affect the share of children who are vaccinated?</p><p>In the chart we see the comparison of vaccination rates &#x2013; here as the share of children who were immunized against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DTP) in 2015, the latest year available &#x2013; to the share of respondents in a given country who disagreed that vaccines are safe.</p><p>You can also <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/immunization-measles-vs-vaccine-safety">see this relationship</a> for measles vaccine coverage.</p><p>Overall we see that widespread public concern for vaccine safety does not appear to be strongly correlated with vaccination rates. While one-third of the French public disagrees with their safety, 97% of children in France are vaccinated.</p><p>There are numerous other reasons, however, why vaccination rates in some countries are low: in low-to-middle income countries the availability, affordability and access to vaccines can be poor. Having low coverage rates often doesn&#x2019;t reflect the population&#x2019;s view of them. As the chart shows, in many poor countries the situation is the opposite as in France: the vast majority of the population considers vaccine safe, but only about every second child receives the DTP vaccine.</p><p>One country which stands out is Ukraine: there we see that vaccination rates are uncharacteristically low for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank">its income level</a> &#x2013; less than 1-in-4 children receive the DTP vaccine. Skepticism of vaccine safety in Ukraine is high at 15%.</p><p>Is there evidence that skepticism is reflected in cases and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases? Over the last few years there has been <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-may-2019-measles-euro/en/">a reported rise</a> in the number of measles cases in countries which had previously been close to eliminating the disease. In Europe, for example, there were more than <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-may-2019-measles-euro/en/">34,000 cases of measles</a> in the first two months of 2019 alone. Ukraine <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-may-2019-measles-euro/en/">accounted for the majority</a> (more than 70%) of these cases. And here as well as in Albania and Romania some measles cases led to the death of children.</p><p>The visualization shows the relationship between the share of people who trust doctors and nurses in their country and share who disagree that vaccines are safe. Overall we see that countries with higher levels of distrust in the safety of vaccines tend to also have less trust in health professionals.</p><p>There are however some outliers: France has relatively high trust in health staff, but are most mistrusting of vaccine safety.</p><p>Health officials are worried that skepticism of vaccination will begin to translate to lower vaccination rates. One reason being attributed to higher skepticism is the spread of misinformation on social media.</p><p>Social media firms do have a responsibility for dealing with misinformation and need to consider how to react carefully. Currently, social and online media companies are being asked by politicians in the US and UK to ban or control anti-vaccination messaging. Banning or strict control could reduce the exposure to such messages but does not solve the root problem: the public are asking questions about vaccines and are looking to find answers online. A worry is that banning certain sorts of information and groups will fuel suspicion and only drive activity elsewhere.</p><p>Nonetheless, demands on social media firms to act is increasing. A request for action by <a href="https://schiff.house.gov/news/press-releases/schiff-sends-letter-to-google-facebook-regarding-anti-vaccine-misinformation">Adam Schiff to the CEOs of Google and Facebook</a> sparked a cascade of responses. In an open letter, he asked for action against vaccine misinformation and similar demands have been made since, from the UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock among others.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/perception-of-the-safety-of-vaccines-vs-vaccine-coverage" class="grapherPreview">

Navin and Largent (2017) provide a helpful distinction between these policies. A compulsory policy is when refusing vaccination is illegal, while mandatory vaccination when certain goods and services are limited for not vaccinating.<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a></p><p>Which policy is followed has depended much on historical legacy, which becomes clear when one considers some of the different regulations and their history around the world:</p><p><em>Compulsory vaccination:</em> Many Eastern Bloc countries introduced compulsory vaccination during the communist era. Vaccination was previously compulsory in Romania for example and after a drop in vaccination rates the country is going through the process of reintroducing compulsory vaccination. The same is true for Italy and also France, which had compulsory vaccination for three diseases but increased this number to 11 in January 2018 in response to a drop in vaccination rates.</p><p><em>Mandatory vaccination:</em> Some countries, such as the United States, have mandates for vaccination where a child is required to be vaccinated to enter state school or daycare. An early case in the US paved the way for state jurisdiction to protect public health in light of personal liberty.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a> In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905) the Supreme Court ruled that states have the authority to require vaccination against smallpox during a smallpox epidemic. Since then the US has had a history of school vaccination requirements. The increased number of children in public schools as a result of the compulsory school attendance law led to an increased risk of smallpox outbreaks, through close contact in large crowded classrooms.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a> Similarly in Australia two policies penalize parents for not vaccinating their children. The &#x2018;No jab no play&#x2019; policy removed unvaccinated children from state-sponsored childcare. The 2016 &#x2018;No jab no pay&#x2019; policy removes state welfare by not providing the universal &#x2018;Family Allowance&#x2019; welfare payments for parents who are conscientious objectors of vaccination.</p><p><em>Voluntary vaccination:</em> Some countries where vaccination is voluntary had early pushback against vaccination, as in the UK and the Netherlands. In 1853 a law was passed in England and Wales requiring universal vaccination against smallpox, but opposition from anti-vaccinationists led to laws being passed to allow for conscientious objection.<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a></p><p><em>Vaccination requirements for country entry:</em> For countries in Africa and South America where yellow fever is endemic or where the mosquito vector is present a certificate of proof of vaccination is required. Only then will the country issue a visa upon entry to that country to prevent importation of this disease (particularly if travellers come from, or have visited other yellow fever endemic areas).<a id="ref-31" class="ref" href="#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a> In past centuries (17th to 19th), yellow fever was transported to North America and Europe, causing large outbreaks that disrupted economies and development, and in some cases decimated populations. Throughout the 18th and 19th century, yellow fever was among the most feared diseases in the ports of the Old and New World. Saudi Arabia is the only country that requires the <a href="http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20170408/en/">additional vaccinations of meningococcal disease and polio</a> for pilgrims visiting Mecca.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="does-it-work-to-make-vaccinations-compulsory"><a class="deep-link" href="#does-it-work-to-make-vaccinations-compulsory"></a>Does it work to make vaccinations compulsory?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Whether compulsory vaccination results in improved vaccination rates is not a straightforward question to tackle because it is highly dependant on country context, historical circumstance, cultural and social norms, as well as the practicalities of implementing and enforcing such a law. </p><p>Certainly in <a href="https://theconversation.com/despite-scepticism-europe-has-high-vaccination-rates-but-it-shouldnt-be-complacent-75169">Eastern Bloc countries</a> when the vaccination law was compulsory, vaccination rates have been high but it is unclear whether to attribute this to the law or the behaviours and mechanisms of compliance under communist rule. Certain vaccinations have historically been compulsory such as smallpox, polio, and yellow fever. Here vaccination rates have also been high but it also encouraged organised opposition to vaccination and public discontent. This is a major concern for public health authorities that a relationship of trust, between governments and citizens is threatened (particularly for health where a rhetoric of self-responsibility, personalisation, and choice is encouraged). </p><p>There are countries with high vaccination rates without compulsory vaccination and governments do not want to disrupt public trust and self-responsibility by making vaccination compulsory, particularly if it is not seen as needed. It has been argued that high coverage has been achieved through &#x201C;other approaches or efforts&#x201D; and so acceptance of compulsory vaccination might be problematic in countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the UK.<a id="ref-32" class="ref" href="#note-32"><sup>32</sup></a> </p><p>In recent years governments have acted in response to epidemics to make vaccinations compulsory, as we have seen for 2017-18 with compulsory vaccinations in France, Italy, Germany, and Romania.</p><p>One country where we can see the effect of variation in vaccination policy is the US. In the US states decide what vaccine exemptions are permitted for children who receive education in schools or use daycare. Public schooling unfortunately means that schools are sites of epidemics for childhood diseases, which is the reason such vaccination laws are required.</p><p>In individual states exemptions are granted for medical reasons but many states also allow for philosophical, personal belief or religious exemptions. Only three states &#x2013; Mississippi, West Virginia, and California &#x2013; only allow for medical exemption. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-10-at-15.31.35.png">Californian immunization rates have increased</a> following a new Senate Bill SB 277 in 2015 to remove non-medical exemptions to vaccination. </p><p>The chart here shows vaccination coverage and what exemptions are allowed for each state. Fewer exemptions generally mean higher vaccine coverage. Indeed, Mississippi does often top the list as having the highest vaccination rates because only medical exemptions are allowed in the state. But starkly, Mississippi residents are also consistently the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.de/unhealthiest-states-in-the-us-health-rankings-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T">unhealthiest</a> and <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2017/09/14/mississippi-still-worst-poverty-household-income-u-s/">poorest</a> in the entire country. Health outcomes are very poor and many residents cannot afford healthcare (<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2017/09/14/mississippi-still-worst-poverty-household-income-u-s/">the state has the highest percentage without health insurance in 2017</a>). So perhaps it is unsurprising that residents accept subsidized vaccinations that are required for access to childcare and state schools.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Vaccination coverage of children, by US state in 2016/17<a id="ref-33" class="ref" href="#note-33"><sup>33</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/12/DTP-Vaccination-rate-by-US-State-and-exemption-status-1-521x550.png" alt="Dtp vaccination rate by us state and exemption status 1" class="wp-image-15521" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/12/DTP-Vaccination-rate-by-US-State-and-exemption-status-1-521x550.png 521w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/12/DTP-Vaccination-rate-by-US-State-and-exemption-status-1-142x150.png 142w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/12/DTP-Vaccination-rate-by-US-State-and-exemption-status-1-379x400.png 379w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/12/DTP-Vaccination-rate-by-US-State-and-exemption-status-1-768x811.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/12/DTP-Vaccination-rate-by-US-State-and-exemption-status-1.png"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="vaccine-supply"><a class="deep-link" href="#vaccine-supply"></a>Vaccine supply</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Supply constraints have caused problems for country access to vaccination.

Romania experienced a situation of parallel vaccine exports in 2016 where more vaccines were exported than was supplied to meet the country&#x2019;s needs.

For newer vaccines there are often particularly few suppliers due to the high investment needed to develop a vaccine.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a> As one would expect from competition, the WHO reports that when vaccines are produced by a greater number of suppliers it leads to a decline of the prices of those vaccines.<a id="ref-39" class="ref" href="#note-39"><sup>39</sup></a></p><p class="p2">In the past vaccines were often viewed as less profitable products for pharmaceutical companies, which led to a lack of investment and some companies pulling out of production altogether.<a id="ref-40" class="ref" href="#note-40"><sup>40</sup></a></p><p>But this has changed as the revenue of the global vaccines market has increased and richer country governments and insurance companies have been willing to pay more for new vaccines.</p><p class="p2">In addition, growing economies such as India and China are investing more in vaccines as well as developing their domestic manufacturing capacity. Poorer countries now have Gavi to help governments pool resources and make advance purchase commitments.<a id="ref-41" class="ref" href="#note-41"><sup>41</sup></a></p><p>Gavi is an international organisation created in 2000 to bring together public and private sectors, with the goal of equal access to new and underused vaccines for children in poorer countries. It subsidizes vaccines that otherwise would not be affordable for low-income countries. In addition to subsidizing vaccines themselves, Gavi offers <a href="https://www.gavi.org/about/programme-policies/health-system-and-immunisation-strengthening-support-framework/">vaccine introduction grants</a>, which help to cover the costs of introduction of new vaccines into routine immunization schedules. The map here shows which countries are eligible for GAVI support. </p><p>Some vaccines still remain expensive. For example, the pertussis vaccine is available in two versions: whole cell (wP) containing the whole pertussis bacterium or acellular (aP) which contains a part of the pertussis bacterium. The pertussis vaccine is often combined with diphtheria and tetanus to produce either a DTwP or DTaP vaccine.<a id="ref-42" class="ref" href="#note-42"><sup>42</sup></a></p><cite class="iUh30"><br></cite><p>DTaP is slightly more expensive; it is sometimes called &#x2018;the painless vaccine&#x2019; because it causes less of a local reaction and pain but should not be given to children over the age of seven. However, DTwP has been shown to be more efficacious at preventing the transmission and spread of disease to unvaccinated people and to those with weak immunity.</p><p>New vaccines tend to be more expensive as they are under patent protection. For example when the HepB vaccine was developed many lower income countries could not afford to pay $30 per dose.<a id="ref-43" class="ref" href="#note-43"><sup>43</sup></a></p><p>Today there is often a differentiation between the prices paid by countries as shown in the small table.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gavi-supported-countries" class="grapherPreview">

The question that follows is why there is a difference in opinion for introducing widespread uptake of a vaccine or not. Japan was one of the first countries to adopt universal chickenpox vaccination.<a id="ref-45" class="ref" href="#note-45"><sup>45</sup></a></p><p>Australia, Canada, Germany, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Uruguay, U.S., Italy (Sicily only) and Spain (Madrid only) followed afterwards and adopted universal chickenpox vaccination. When extreme cases of chickenpox have occurred there have been calls for the vaccine to become <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-36952432">available for free</a> through the National Health Service in the UK. However, most European countries do not vaccinate against chickenpox, except for &#x2018;at risk&#x2019; groups. The main reason for not adopting universal vaccination is the high cost. Additional supporting justifications are that it is usually a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1032.aspx?CategoryID=62">mild disease</a> and the&#xA0;benefit of fewer cases of shingles &#x2013; as explained <a href="https://theconversation.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chickenpox-and-why-more-countries-dont-use-the-vaccine-63473">here</a>.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US ran&#xA0;the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/surveillance/vasp.html">Varicella Active Surveillance Project</a> (VASP)&#xA0;from 1995 through to 2010 to monitor the&#xA0;impact of the varicella vaccination program and the key finding is shown in the chart. The coverage of the vaccine in&#xA0;Los Angeles County rose from 37.9% in 1997 to 95.1% in 2010, and in Philadelphia from 41.2% in 1997 to 94.6% in 2010&#xA0;(one-dose vaccinations for children between 19 and 35 months of age). By 2010, varicella incidence declined by 98% in Antelope Valley (California) and West Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) compared with 1995. Outbreaks and hospitalizations also decreased rapidly. From 1995 to 1998, hospitalization rates ranged from 2.2 to 3.3 per 100,000 population but by 2006-2010 this had declined to 0.2 per 100,000 in Antelope Valley and 0.5 per 100,000 in Philadelphia.</p><p>Chickenpox is an example that can also help to answer the question of whether better hygiene or vaccination are in fact responsible for the reduced rates of disease. Although both are important, a more recently adopted vaccination such as chickenpox can demonstrate the effects of vaccination in reducing the rate of disease after the importance of hygiene was discovered and became a preventative measure against disease. As hygiene standards already reached high levels, the additional benefit of the vaccine is confirmed. The impact on disease rates demonstrate it is not hygiene but vaccination that reduced the incidence of chickenpox so dramatically in the US.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Chickenpox-cases-in-US-786x550.png" alt="Chickenpox cases in us" class="wp-image-28812" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Chickenpox-cases-in-US-786x550.png 786w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Chickenpox-cases-in-US-400x280.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Chickenpox-cases-in-US-150x105.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Chickenpox-cases-in-US-768x538.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Chickenpox-cases-in-US-1536x1075.png 1536w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Chickenpox-cases-in-US-2048x1434.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Chickenpox-cases-in-US.png"></figure></div></div></section>

However, in addition to delivering the vaccine for those who need it, we also need to work on improving its efficacy.</p><p>Vaccine efficacy for the rotavirus vaccine is defined as the percentage reduction of the rate of diarrhea incidences in vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups of children. It is well established that the efficacy of the rotavirus vaccine is not the same across all countries &#x2014; in countries with high child mortality rates the vaccine shows much lower efficacy.<a id="ref-60" class="ref" href="#note-60"><sup>60</sup></a></p><p>The chart is from a recent study by Clark et <em>al.</em>, which looked at how the efficacy of live oral rotavirus vaccines changes in different countries following vaccination. The chart shows that in countries with high child mortality rates, not only is the immediate vaccine efficacy lower &#x2013; 98% in low child mortality countries versus 66% in high child mortality countries &#x2013; but also the vaccine efficacy decreases faster in high child mortality countries over time.<a id="ref-61" class="ref" href="#note-61"><sup>61</sup></a></p><p> Five years after vaccination, the rotavirus vaccine reduces the chances of getting diarrhea by 90% in low child mortality countries and only by 30% in high mortality countries.</p><p>The table shows how good the rotavirus vaccine is at preventing severe diarrhea and reducing hospitalization due to diarrhea in children under-5 in different regions.<a id="ref-62" class="ref" href="#note-62"><sup>62</sup></a></p><p> In high-income countries, rotavirus vaccination has been shown to reduce the cases of severe rotavirus diarrhea by 91% and hospitalization by 94%. In Eastern Asia and Latin America, the effectiveness rates are lower but still high &#x2013; preventing 88% and 80% of severe diarrhea cases, respectively. However, effectiveness in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa is significantly lower, only reducing severe diarrhea in around half of the cases.</p><p>The reasons for different responses to the vaccine are not entirely clear.<a id="ref-63" class="ref" href="#note-63"><sup>63</sup></a> <a id="ref-64" class="ref" href="#note-64"><sup>64</sup></a></p><p> It is likely that the gut responses to the oral rotavirus vaccines in children in lower-income countries are different. This may be due to a variety of causes, including <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/micronutrient-deficiency">micronutrient deficiencies</a>, pre-vaccination exposure to certain pathogens, and the presence of chronic conditions such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria">malaria</a> or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids">HIV</a>. Overall, the poor gut response to the live vaccine means the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced. Taking all of the above mentioned points into account, there are several interventions that could increase the benefits of the rotavirus vaccine even further. In addition to increasing the vaccine coverage, improving nutritional health (of both infants and mothers) and improving hygiene and sanitation conditions (to lower the prevalence of damaging pathogens) could have positive effects on the vaccine&#x2019;s efficacy.</p><p>We are still at quite an early stage of the rotavirus vaccine use. Although the vaccine has brought huge benefits already, it could go even further. Improving vaccination coverage, particularly across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is key to continued reduction of childhood deaths from diarrhea. Even at moderate levels of vaccine efficacy, a significant number of additional additional child deaths could be prevented every year. The bar chart above that shows the number of preventable deaths illustrates the potential for extended vaccine coverage to save many more lives.

Generally, the bacterium is harmless or causes milder illnesses such as bronchitis, sinusitis, and ear infections. Pneumococcal vaccines are effective against these milder illnesses as well, but importantly also protects from what is called pneumococcal invasive disease (PID). PID occurs when the pneumococcus moves from colonizing the upper respiratory tract to colonizing sites that are normally sterile, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid or pleural cavity (fluid-filled space surrounding the lungs).<a id="ref-67" class="ref" href="#note-67"><sup>67</sup></a> Bacterial invasion leads to life-threatening diseases such as sepsis, meningitis and severe pneumonia.&#xA0;</p><p>There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines available: conjugated polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) and non-conjugated polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV).

</div><footer class="article-footer"><div class="wp-block-columns"><div class="wp-block-column"><h3 id="references">References</h3><ol class="references"><li id="note-1"><p>This and other numbers in this entry are based on the estimates by the World Health Organisation. The coverage estimates are calculated by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population. Target population size is usually based on census population projections.</p>



<p>This means that there may be children in the target population that for medical reasons should be exempt from vaccination. These medical reasons may include factors such as allergies to vaccine components or severe immunodeficiencies. </p>



<p>Notably, such cases are very rare and would have little effect on global coverage numbers. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4783279/">a study</a> from 2003 identified severe allergic reaction in only 0.000063% of all vaccinations, that&#8217;s 0.63 cases per million vaccinations. In addition, vaccines are always being improved with fewer ingredients that may cause allergic reactions. </p>



<p>Vaccination of children with immunodeficiencies generally needs to be assessed by a specialist. Especially, for vaccine that are based on a live pathogens. For example, <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/policy/Immunization_routine_table1.pdf">WHO recommends</a> vaccinating HIV-positive children with measles vaccine if child&#8217;s HIV infection is asymptomatic or not severe. Similarly, children with severe immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID), a genetic disorder that causes defects in immune system, are <a href="https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-we-treat/severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid">safely vaccinated</a> with many vaccines before SCID is even diagnosed, but it&#8217;s recommended not to vaccinate them with live vaccines. </p>



<p>In fact, one of the reasons it is important to increase vaccination rates is that those children and adults who for medical reasons cannot be vaccinated would still be protected from diseases through <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#how-vaccines-work-herd-immunity">herd immunity</a>.</p></li><li id="note-2"><p> <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/immunization-coverage">https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/immunization-coverage</a></p></li><li id="note-3"><p>UNICEF (1996) and Hinman, A. R. (1998) estimate that in the absence of a vaccine the world would have seen 5 million deaths due to smallpox every year in the mid-1990s.</p>



<p>Assuming that the estimate for the mid-1990s provides a midpoint estimate for the period since 1980 and therefore multiplying the 5 million per year estimate by the number of years between 1980 and 2018 means that since the eradication of the disease 190 million people’s lives were saved.</p>

<p><strong>Terminology: <em>vaccination</em> and <em>immunization</em></strong></p>



<p>There is a technical difference between vaccination and immunization, as the National Health Service (NHS)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shb.scot.nhs.uk/board/publichealth/immunisation.asp">explains</a>: “Vaccination means having a vaccine – that is actually getting the injection, or nasal spray or oral vaccine. Immunization means both receiving a vaccine and then becoming immune to a disease”. The distinction is made because in a very small number of those who are vaccinated the vaccination will not ‘take’ and therefore that vaccinated person will not be immunized (i.e. will not be immune to the disease). However, as this refers to a very small number of people both terms are often used interchangeably across the academic literature and in media reporting and we follow this convention in this entry.</p></li><li id="note-24"><p>For the WHO recommendations see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.who.int/ith/vaccines/en/">http://www.who.int/ith/vaccines/en/</a></p>



<p>The Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) is recommended in countries where TB is common. BCG policies and practices have varied considerably across time and countries.

<p>The cost of rotavirus vaccines varies by country. For example, countries with a gross national income per capita of less than US$1,000 receive subsidies from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, and there the cost per dose is <a href="https://www.unicef.org/supply/files/Rotavaccine.pdf">set between US$2.10 &#8211; 3.20</a>. With additional co-financing options can reduce the costs <a href="https://www.sabin.org/sites/sabin.org/files/frederic_debellut.pdf">down to US$0.13</a>. In high-income countries, such as the US, the cost per dose is between <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/index.html">US$70 and 95</a></p>



<p>Countries are more likely to introduce the vaccine if the political environment is favourably disposed towards them. For example, if a country has set a high priority on achieving the Millennium Development Goal targets or the introduction of vaccines is seen as a positive news story, especially during election years.</p>
