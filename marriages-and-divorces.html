<ul><li>In 1920, shortly after the First World War, there were 12 marriages for every 1,000 people in the US.&#xA0;</li><li>In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, the rate fell sharply, and then during the Second World War marriages rose again, reaching a peak of 16.4 marriages per 1,000 people in 1946.</li><li>Marriage rates fell down again in the 1950s, bounced back up in the 1960s, and then started going down in the 1970s.</li><li>Since 1970, marriage rates in the US have fallen by almost 50%, and are currently at the lowest point in recorded history.</li></ul>



<p>In comparison to other rich countries, the US has had particularly high historical marriage rates. But in terms of changes over time, the trend looks similar for other rich countries. The UK and Australia, for example, have also seen marriage rates declining for decades, and are currently at the lowest point in recorded history.</p>



<p>For non-rich countries the data is sparse, but available estimates from Latin America, Africa and Asia suggest that the decline of marriages is not exclusive to rich countries. Over the period 1990 &#x2013; 2010 there was a decline&#xA0;in marriage rates in the majority of countries around the world.</p>



<p>But there&#x2019;s still a lot of cross-country variation around this general trend, and in some countries changes are going in the opposite direction. In China, Russia and Bangladesh, for example, marriages are more common today than a couple of decades ago.</p>

<p>We can also compare how likely people of different generations were to be married by a given age. That&#x2019;s possible because, in many rich countries, there are statistical records going back several generations, allowing us to estimate marriage rates by age and year of birth. This gives us another perspective on the historical decline of marriages. The chart here uses those records to give marriage rates by age and year of birth for five cohorts of English men.</p>



<p>For instance, you can look at 30-year-olds, and see what percentage of them in each cohort was married. Of those men who were born in 1940, about  83% were married by age 30. Among those born in 1980 only about 25% were married by age 30.</p>



<p>The trend is stark. English men in more recent cohorts are much less likely to have married, and that&#x2019;s true at all ages.</p>



<p>There are two causes for this: one, more people in younger cohorts have chosen not to marry; and two, newer cohorts are increasingly choosing to marry later in life. We explore this point below.</p>

In recent decades cohabitation has become increasingly common around the world. In the US, for example, the US Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/11/cohabitaiton-is-up-marriage-is-down-for-young-adults.html">estimates</a> that the share of young adults between the age of 18 and 24 living with an unmarried partner went up from 0.1% to 9.4% over the period 1968-2018; and according to a <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/11/06/marriage-and-cohabitation-in-the-u-s/">recent survey</a> from Pew Research, today most Americans favor allowing unmarried couples to have the same legal rights as married couples.</p><p>The increase in cohabitation is the result of the fact that fewer people are choosing to marry, as well as the fact that people who marry tend to do it when they are older, and often live with their partner before getting married. In the UK, for example, 85.1% of people who get married cohabited first.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Direct long-run data on the prevalence of cohabitation across countries is not available, but some indirect estimates are. In particular, the proportion of births outside marriage provide a relevant proxy measure, allowing comparisons across countries and time; if more unmarried people are having children, it suggests that more people are entering long-term cohabiting relationships without first getting married. It isn&#x2019;t a perfect proxy &#x2013; as we&#x2019;ll see below, rates of single parenting have also changed, meaning that rates of births outside marriage will not coincide perfectly with cohabitation rates &#x2013; but it provides some information regarding the direction of change.</p><p>The chart here shows the percentage of all births that correspond to couples who are not married, based on estimates from the OECD.</p><p>As we can see, the proportion of children born outside of marriage has increased substantially in almost all OECD countries in recent decades. The exception is Japan, where there has been only a minor increase.</p><p>In 1970, most OECD countries saw less than 10% of children born outside of marriage. In 2014, most countries had more than 20%, and many saw more than half.</p><p>The trend is not restricted to very rich countries. In Mexico and Costa Rica, for example, the increase has been very large, and today the majority of children are born to unmarried parents.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-births-outside-marriage" class="grapherPreview">

In the last decades, many countries have seen an increase in cohabitation, and it is becoming more common for children to live with a single parent, or with parents who are not married.</p><p>These changes have come together with a large and significant shift in people&#x2019;s perceptions of the types of family structures that are possible, acceptable and desirable. Perhaps the clearest example of this is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/same-sex-marriage-country-count">rise of same-sex marriage</a>.</p><p>It&#x2019;s easy to assume that social institutions that have been around for thousands of years can only change slowly. The de-institutionalization of marriage and the rise of new family models since the middle of the 20th century show that this assumption is wrong.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

Are divorces on the rise across the world?</p><p>In the chart here we show the crude divorce rate &#x2013; measured as the number of divorces per 1,000 people in a given population. </p><p>When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its <a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/popfacts/PopFacts_2011-1.pdf">overview of global marriage patterns</a> notes that there is a general upward trend: &#x201C;at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.&#x201D;</p><p>But, when we look more closely at the data we can also see that this misses two key insights: there are notable differences between countries; and it fails to capture the pattern of these changes in the period from the 1990s to today. </p><p>As we see in the chart, for many countries divorce rates increased markedly between the 1970s and 1990s. In the US, divorce rates more than doubled from 2.2 per 1,000 in 1960 to over 5 per 1,000 in the 1980s. In the UK, Norway and South Korea, divorce rates more than tripled. But we also see that divorce rates then fell in the decades that followed. In the US and UK, for example, they&#x2019;re roughly back to their 1970 levels. </p><p>In general the trends vary substantially from country-to-country.  The US stands out as a bit of an outlier, with consistently higher divorce rates than most other countries, but also an earlier &#x2018;peak&#x2019;. South Korea had a much later &#x2018;peak&#x2019;, with divorce rates continuing to rise until the early 2000s. In other countries &#x2013; such as Mexico and Turkey &#x2013; divorces continue to rise. As the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/social/family/SF_3_1_Marriage_and_divorce_rates.pdf">OECD Family Database</a> notes, between 1995 and 2017 (or the nearest available estimate), divorce rates increased in 18 OECD countries, but fell in 12 others.</p><p>The pattern of rising divorce rates, followed by a plateau or fall in some countries (particularly richer countries) might be partially explained by the differences in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/marriages-and-divorces#divorces-by-age-the-recent-reduction-in-divorce-rates-might-be-explained-by-lower-likelihood-of-divorce-in-younger-cohorts">divorce rates across cohorts</a>, and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/marriages-and-divorces#length-of-marriage">delay in marriage</a> we see in younger couples today. </p><p>Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/female-labor-supply">rise in female employment</a> may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s. According to this hypothesis, marriages in the US may be more stable today because younger cohorts tend to delay marriage, which allows them to better-evaluate what they want in a partner.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/divorces-per-1000-people" class="grapherPreview">

First, crude rates mix a large number of cohorts &#x2013; both older and young couples; and second, they do not account for how the number of marriages is changing. To understand how patterns of divorce are changing it is more helpful to look at percentage of marriages that end in divorce, and look in more detail at these patterns by cohort.  Let&#x2019;s take a look at one example where divorce rates have seen a decline in recent decades.</p><p>In the chart here we show the percentage (as opposed to the crude rates) of marriages which ended in divorce in England and Wales since 1963. This is broken down by the number of years after marriage &#x2013; that is, the percentage of couples who had divorced five, ten and twenty years after marriage.</p><p>Here we see that for all three lines, the overall pattern is similar: the share of marriages that end in divorce increased through the 1960s to the 1990s. </p><p>In 1963, just 1.5% of couples had divorced before their fifth anniversary; while 7.8% before their tenth and 19% before their twentieth anniversary. By the mid-1990s this had increased to 11%, 25% and 38%, respectively.</p><p>But since then, divorces have been on the decline. The percentage of couples divorcing in the first five years has halved since its 1990s peak, and the percentage within 10 years has also fallen significantly.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/marriages-uk-ended-in-divorce" class="grapherPreview">

<p>What might explain the recent reduction in overall divorce rates in some countries?</p>



<p>This trend may be explained by two key drivers: a reduction in the likelihood of divorce for younger cohorts; and a lengthening of marriage before divorce for those that do separate.</p>



<p>We see both of these factors in the analysis of divorce rates in the US from Betsey Stevenson and Wolfers.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> This chart maps out the percentage of marriages ending in divorce: each line represents the decade they got married (those married in the 1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 1990s) and the x-axis represents the years since the wedding.</p>



<p>We see that the share of marriages ending in divorce increased significantly for couples married in 1960s or 70s compared to the 1950s. The probability of divorce within 10 years was twice as high for couples married in the 1960s versus the 1950s. For those married in the 1970s, it was more than three times as likely.</p>



<p>You might have heard the popularised claim that &#x201C;half of marriages end in divorce&#x201D;. We can see here where that claim might come from: for 48% of couples that married in the 1970s in the US were divorced within 25 years.</p>



<p>But since then the likelihood of divorce has fallen. It fell for couples married in the 1980s, and again for those in the 1990s. Both the likelihood of divorce has been falling, and the length of marriage has been increasing.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>This is also reflected in data for the UK. This chart shows the cumulative share of marriages that ended in divorce: each line represents the year in which couples were married. A useful way to compare different age cohorts is by the steepness of the line: steeper lines indicate a faster accumulation of divorces year-on-year, particularly in the earlier stages of marriages.</p>



<p>You might notice that the divorce curves for couples in the 1960s are shallower and tend to level out in the range of 20% to 30%. Divorce rates then became increasingly steep throughout the 1970s; 80s and 90s, and eventually surpass cumulative rates from the 1960s. But, since the the 1990s, these curves appear to be falling once again, mirroring the findings from the US.</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s important to note that we don&#x2019;t have the long-term insights on marriages for younger couples today. It will take several decades before we have the full picture on more recent marriages and their eventual outcomes.</p>

</div><h3 id="marriages-in-many-countries-are-getting-longer"><a class="deep-link" href="#marriages-in-many-countries-are-getting-longer"></a>Marriages in many countries are getting longer</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>As we saw from data on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/marriages-and-divorces#divorce-rates">divorce rates</a>, in some countries &#x2013; particularly richer countries such as the UK, US and Germany &#x2013; divorce rates have been falling since the 1990s. This could be partially explained by a reduction in the <em>share</em> of marriages ending in divorce, but also by the length of marriages before their dissolution. </p><p>How has the length of marriages changed over time?</p><p>In the chart here we see the average duration of marriages before divorce across a number of countries where this data is available. An important point to note here is that the way these averages are reported are not consistent across countries: some countries report this as the <em>median</em> length of marriage; others as the <em>mean</em>. Since the distribution of marriage lengths is often skewed, the median and mean value can be very different. As the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/divorce/bulletins/divorcesinenglandandwales/2018">UK Office for National Statistics</a> notes:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#x201C;The median duration of marriage at divorce in this release is represented by the middle value when the data are arranged in increasing order. The median is used, rather than the mean, because the duration of marriage for divorces is not symmetrically distributed. Therefore, the median provides a more accurate reflection of this distribution. The mean would be affected by the relatively small number of divorces that take place when duration of marriage exceeds 15 years.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p>So, we have to keep this in mind when interpreting these statistics and be careful when trying to make country-by-country comparisons. On the chart shown we note for each country whether the average marriage duration is given as the median or mean value from national statistical agencies.</p><p>But, we can gain insights for single countries <em>over time</em>. What we see for a number of countries is that the average duration of marriage before divorce has been increasing since the 1990s or early 2000s. If we take the UK as an example: marriages got notably shorter between the the 1970s to the later 1980s, falling from around 12 to 9 years. But, marriages have once again increased in length, rising back to over 12 years.</p><p>This mirrors what we saw in data on the share of marriages ending in divorce: divorce rates increased significantly between the 1960s/70s through the 1990s, but have seen a fall since then. </p><p>We see a similar pattern in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore. However, there is still a significant amount of heterogeneity between countries.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/avg-duration-marriages" class="grapherPreview">
