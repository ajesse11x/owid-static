&#x2013; such as the provision of public goods or the redistribution of resources. In this entry we study public spending through the lens of aggregate cross-country data on government expenditures. We begin with an analysis of historical trends, and then move on to analyze recent developments in public spending patterns around the world.</p><p>The available long-run data shows that the role and size of governments around the world has changed drastically in the last couple of centuries. In early-industrilized countries, specifically, the historical data shows that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#government-spending-in-early-industrialised-countries-grew-remarkably-during-the-last-century">public spending increased remarkably in the 20th century</a>, as governments started spending more resources on social protection, education and healthcare.</p><p>Recent data on public spending reveals substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Relative to low-income countries, <a href="#recent-data-on-the-size-of-governments">government expenditure in high-income countries tends to be much larger</a> (both in per capita terms, and as share of GDP), and it also <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#high-income-countries-spend-more-on-social-protection-than-low-income-countries">tends to be more focused on social protection</a>.</p><p>Recent data on public spending also shows that governments around the world <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#procurement-plays-an-important-role-in-government-expenditure">often rely on the private sector to produce and manage goods and services</a>. And public-private partnerships (PPP), in particular, have become an increasingly popular mechanism for governments to finance, design, build and operate infrastructure projects. In the period 2005-2010 alone, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#procurement-of-infrastructure-projects-has-grown-substantially-in-low-and-middle-income-countries">the total value of PPP projects in low and middle-income countries more than doubled</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="block-wrapper" data-reactroot><div data-variation="full-width" class="wp-block-owid-additional-information"><h3 id="all-our-charts-on-government-spending"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="angle-right" class="svg-inline--fa fa-angle-right fa-w-8 " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M224.3 273l-136 136c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.6-22.6c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l96.4-96.4-96.4-96.4c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L54.3 103c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l136 136c9.5 9.4 9.5 24.6.1 34z"/></svg>All our charts on Government Spending</h3><div style="height:0;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" class="rah-static rah-static--height-zero"><div style="transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;-webkit-transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;opacity:0"><div class="content">

The source of the data is Mauro et al. (2015).<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>The long-run series in this dataset cover mainly, but not exclusively OECD countries. Non-OECD countries with available long-run data include Russia, India, Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Colombia.</p><p>The above-mentioned long-run series are complemented in this dataset by comparable recent estimates for most countries in the world. You can plot other countries in this visualization by selecting &#x2018;Add Country&#x2019;; but bear in mind that the series for most non-OECD countries are much shorter.</p><p>If we focus on early-industrialized countries, we can see that there are four broad periods in this chart. In the first period, until the First World War, spending was generally low. In the US, for example, total government expenditure accounted for less than 2% of national income until 1916. These low levels of public spending were just enough for governments to be concerned with basic functions, such as maintaining order and enforcing property rights.</p><p>In the second period, between 1915-1945, public spending was generally volatile, particularly for countries that were more heavily involved in the First and Second World Wars. Government expenditures as a share of national output went sharply up and down in these countries, mainly because of changes in defense spending and national incomes. In the US, public spending as a share of GDP was 10.5% in 1941, then went up to 44.1% in 1945, and then went back down to 12.2% in 1948.</p><p>In the third period, between 1945-1980, public spending grew particularly fast. As we show in more detail later, this was the result of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#public-spending-growth-in-early-industrialised-countries-was-largely-driven-by-social-spending">growth in <em>social</em> spending</a>; and was largely made possible by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/#taxes-started-growing-in-early-industrialised-countries-after-the-first-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historical increases in government revenues over the same period</a>.</p><p>Since 1980 the growth of government expenditure has been slowing down in early-industrialized countries &#x2013; and in some cases, it has gone down in relative terms. However, in spite of differences in levels, in all these countries public spending as a share of GDP is higher today than before the Second World War.</p><p>Although the increase in public spending has not been equal in all countries, it is still remarkable that growth has been a general phenomenon, despite large underlying institutional differences.</p><p>The map uses the same data, for all countries, to show global patterns. You can switch between the &#x2018;Map&#x2019; and &#x2018;Chart&#x2019; views by selecting the corresponding tabs in the interactive visualziation. By using the slider at the bottom you can get a sense of the long-run trend in global government expenditures.</p><p>At the end of the 19th century European countries spent less than 10% of GDP via the government. In the 21st century this figure exceeds 50% in many European countries. The increase in absolute terms &#x2013; rather than the shown relative terms &#x2013; is much larger since the level of GDP per capita increased very substantially over this period.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/historical-gov-spending-gdp" class="grapherPreview">

The data is published as part of the World Development Indicators and comes from the IMF.</p><p>The most striking feature in the chart is the degree of heterogeneity between world regions. Central governments in high-income countries &#x2013; particularly those in Europe &#x2013; tend to control a much larger share of national production than governments in low-income countries.</p><p>In countries such as France, central government spending accounts for almost 50% of all national output. In Nigeria the corresponding figure is close to 6%.</p><p>Although there are many missing observations, the data suggests that the first decade of the 21st century was characterized by a broad positive trend. You can explore more detailed country-specific time trends by selecting the &#x2018;Chart&#x2019; tab, located on top of the map.</p><p>These estimates have to be interpreted with caution, since central government expenditure provides a somewhat distorted picture of total public spending, particularly in federal countries with large sub-national governments. As we discuss in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#limitations">data quality section</a>, it is unfortunately hard to find reliable cross-country data on expenditure below the central level.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-gov-expenditure-gdp-wdi" class="grapherPreview">

The first chart shows the value of total general government procurement as percentage of GDP, while the second chart shows the relative weight of procurement within total expenditure (i.e. general government procurement as a percentage of total government expenditures).</p><p>As we can see, public sector purchases from the private sector are significant in many high-income countries. In the Netherlands, almost 45% of total government expenditure is channeled through procurement. This corresponds to about 20% of the national income of the Netherlands.

The IDD provides further details regarding how these estimates are constructed. In a nutshell, income &#x2018;before taxes&#x2019; corresponds to what is usually known as market income (wages and salaries, self-employment income, capital and property income); while income after taxes and transfers corresponds to disposable income (market income, plus social security, cash transfers and private transfers, minus income taxes).</p><p>The data shows that across the 35 countries covered, taxes and transfers lower income inequality by around one-third on average (equivalent to around 0.15 Gini points).

According to the IMF, government expenditure is calculated as the sum of all cash payments for operating activities of the government in providing goods and services, including compensation of employees (such as wages and salaries), interest and subsidies, grants, social benefits, and other expenses such as rents and dividends.</p><p>The IMF, through its Government Finance Statistics Manuals and Guides, recommends an &#x201C;accrual accounting method, focusing on all economic events affecting assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, not just those represented by cash transactions&#x201D;. By construction, the recommended method accounts for changes in stocks, which means that &#x201C;stock data at the end of an accounting period equal stock data at the beginning of the period plus flows over the period.&#x201D; You can learn more about the definitions and accounting methods directly from the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/gfs.htm">IMF Government Finance Statistics Manuals and Guides</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="limitations"><a class="deep-link" href="#limitations"></a>Limitations</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The most important limitation with the estimates produced by the IMF is that, despite their efforts to standardize data collection, many countries report misclassified, incomplete, and untimely statistics.</p><p>The lack of consistent data on local government expenditures often makes cross-country comparisons difficult. Because of this, many studies rely on central government estimates, even though these estimates provide an incomplete picture, especially in federal countries. Additionally, the documentation for the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.XPN.TOTL.GD.ZS">World Development Indicator on Government Expenditure</a> &#x2013; which uses IMF estimates &#x2013; notes: &#x201C;For most countries central government finance data have been consolidated into one account, but for others only budgetary central government accounts are available. Because budgetary accounts may not include all central government units (such as social security funds), they usually provide an incomplete picture.&#x201D;</p><p>The chart provides a comparison of two cross-country measures of government expenditure. The first measure, in the horizontal axis, corresponds to the World Development Indicators, and as mentioned above, corresponds mainly to central government spending. The second measure, in the vertical axis, corresponds to the depurated estimates from Mauro et al. (2015), where the authors tried to incorporate expenditure data across all government levels.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> Note that interest payments on debt have been included in both measures of government expenditure.</p><p>As we can see, while the two measures are correlated, they are still substantially different. A big part of the difference between these two measures can be attributed to the fact that one of them accounts only for central government expenditures &#x2013; indeed, most countries lie above a line with slope one, which suggests that local government expenditure is not negligible. There remains a few countries where there is significant mismatch between total and central government spending- in the case of Costa Rica and Afghanistan, central spending appears to exceed total government spending. In both countries, there appears to be notable inconsistencies both in terms of budget allocation and actual funds distribution between governmental and sub-national entities, and the approval process for spending autonomy by decentralised institutions.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Misclassification and poor standardised within country statistics therefore remains a challenge.</p><p>The above-mentioned limitations are substantially less critical for estimates reported to the OECD by member countries, mainly because they tend to apply more rigorously the agreed international conventions and accounting methods &#x2013; including a consistent accounting of expenditures across sectors and levels of government. However, for countries that are not members or partners of the OECD, the data limitations are severe, and cross-country comparisons over time have to be interpreted with caution.</p><p>In addition to the IMF and the OECD, the WHO and UNESCO also collect and report data on healthcare and education government expenditures. You can read about these sources, including their relationship and limitations, in our entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/#data-quality-measurement">Financing Healthcare</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#data-quality-measurement">Financing Education</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/central-vs-total-government-expenditure-gdp" class="grapherPreview">

To produce this database &#x201C;IFPRI researchers have compiled data from multiple sources, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and national governments, and conducted extensive data checks and adjustments to ensure consistent spending measurements over time that are free of exchange-rate fluctuations and currency denomination changes.&#x201D;</p><p>Unfortunately, despite IFPRI&#x2019;s best efforts, we have reasons to believe that there are substantial remaining problems with the estimates published in the SPEED database. For example, the estimates of government expenditure as a share of GDP in Zimbabwe and Palestine are in the thousands for several years. In such complicated cases it would be better not to report estimates &#x2013; even more so considering that the SPEED database reports regional and global averages that are not country-weighted.<br><br></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>
