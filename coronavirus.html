The entire world has the same goal: cases of COVID-19 need to go to zero.</p><p>The chart below shows which countries are making progress to this goal and which are not.</p><p>The trajectories show the daily number of confirmed cases. But the widely available data on confirmed cases only becomes meaningful when it can be interpreted in light of how much a country is testing. This is why Our World in Data built the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing">global database on COVID-19 testing</a> and the line colors in this chart show whether a country is testing adequately or not.</p><p>A country is not testing adequately when it is finding a case for every few tests they perform. Here it is likely that the true number of new cases is much higher than the number of cases that were confirmed by tests. When the <em>positive rate</em> of tests is high the line is shown in shades of red.</p><p>Blue lines mean that a country does many tests for each case it finds; the testing effort in these countries is adequate.</p><p>&#x2192; We explain this chart and the metrics in much more detail further below in the section <a href="#which-countries-are-making-progress-against-the-pandemic">&#x2018;The chart to monitor the fight against the global pandemic&#x2019;</a>.</p><p>To be safe anywhere, every region in the world needs to make progress against the pandemic &#x2013; and this means dark blue lines hitting zero.</p><p>Progress is possible &#x2013; some countries bent the curve of new cases and are monitoring the outbreak well. But globally we are very far from the goal and the global number of confirmed cases is rising extremely fast.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><figure data-explorer-src="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?yScale=log&amp;zoomToSelection=true&amp;casesMetric=true&amp;dailyFreq=true&amp;aligned=true&amp;smoothing=7&amp;country=USA~KOR~DEU~IND~BRA~ITA~IDN~ZAF~MEX~NZL~NOR~COG&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;pickerSort=asc" class="wp-block-full-content-width" style="width: 100%; min-height: 740px; max-height: 950px; height: 100vh; border: 0px none !important;"><div class="loading-indicator"><span style="border-color:#333"></span></div></figure><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>&#x2192; <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?yScale=log&amp;zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-02-01..&amp;casesMetric=true&amp;dailyFreq=true&amp;aligned=true&amp;smoothing=7&amp;country=USA~KOR~DEU~URY~IND~BRA~ITA~IDN~ZAF~MEX~NZL~TWN~NOR&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;pickerSort=asc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open the Data Explorer</a> in a new tab.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

But data is not enough. This is especially true in this pandemic because even the best available data is far from perfect. Much of our work therefore focuses on explaining what the data can &#x2013; and can not &#x2013; tell us about the pandemic.&#xA0;</p><p>Our goal is two-fold:</p><ol><li>To <strong>provide reliable, global and open data and research</strong> on how the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading, what impact the pandemic has, how we can make progress against the pandemic, and whether the measures countries are taking are successful or not;</li><li>And to <strong>build an infrastructure</strong> that allows research colleagues &#x2013; and everyone who is interested &#x2013; to navigate and understand this data and research.</li></ol><p>Before we study <em>how</em> to make progress we should consider the more basic question: is it possible to do so?</p><p>The answer is very clear: While some countries have failed in their response to the pandemic, others met the challenge much more successfully. Perhaps the most important thing to know about the pandemic is that <em>it is possible to fight the pandemic</em>.</p><p>Responding successfully means two things: limiting the <em>direct</em> and the <em>indirect</em> impact of the pandemic. Countries that have responded most successfully were able to avoid choosing between the two: they avoided the trade-off between a high mortality and a high socio-economic impact of the pandemic. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/new-zealand?country=~NZL">New Zealand</a> has been able to bring infections down and open up their country internally. Other island nations were also able to almost entirely prevent an outbreak (like <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/taiwan?country=~TWN">Taiwan</a>, Australia, and Iceland). But not only islands were able to bend the curve of infections and prevent large outbreaks &#x2013; Norway, Uruguay, Switzerland, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/south-korea?country=~KOR">South Korea</a>, and Germany are examples. These countries suffered a smaller direct impact, but they also limited the indirect impacts because they were able to release lockdown measures earlier.</p><p>Together with colleagues at the Robert Koch Institute, the Chan School of Public Health, the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and other institutions we study countries that responded most successfully in detail.</p><p>The point of this work is to understand those countries so that the rest of the world can learn from them. We have published three country specific studies:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-exemplar-vietnam">Emerging COVID-19 success story: <strong>Vietnam</strong>&#x2019;s commitment to containment</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-exemplar-germany">Emerging COVID-19 success story: <strong>Germany</strong>&#x2019;s strong enabling environment</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-exemplar-south-korea">Emerging COVID-19 success story: <strong>South Korea</strong> learned the lessons of MERS</a></li></ul><p>Together with epidemiologists Anna Seale, Dave Kennedy, and Daniel Bausch we wrote <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/identify-covid-exemplars">this introduction to the Pandemic Exemplar project</a>. We will continue this work over the course of the pandemic so that the world can learn from those countries that are most successful in their fight against the pandemic.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="coronavirus-country-profiles"><a class="deep-link" href="#coronavirus-country-profiles"></a>Coronavirus Country Profiles</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>We built 207 country profiles which allow you to explore <strong>the statistics on the coronavirus pandemic for every country in the world</strong>.</p><p>In a fast-evolving pandemic it is not a simple matter to identify the countries that are most successful in making progress against it.

The trajectories of the death counts make clear just how very differently different countries were impacted.</p><p>The <em>steepness</em> of the slope shows how rapidly the death count was rising at a particular moment in the outbreak. The <em>level</em> shows how many people were confirmed to have died due to COVID-19 in each country.</p><p>Among the countries with the highest death toll are some of the most populous countries in the world such as the US, Brazil, and Mexico. If you prefer to adjust for the differences in population size you can switch to per capita statistics by clicking the &#x2018;per million people&#x2019; tickbox.</p><p>We can see three different ways in which the pandemic has affected countries:</p><ul><li>Some countries have not been able to contain the pandemic. The death toll there continues to rise quickly week after week.</li><li>Some countries saw large outbreaks, but then &#x2018;bent the curve&#x2019; and brought the number of deaths down again. Italy, Germany, and many European countries followed this trajectory.</li><li>Some were able to prevent a large outbreak altogether. Shown in the chart are South Korea and Norway. These countries had rapid outbreaks, but were then able to reduce the number of deaths very quickly to low numbers.</li></ul><p>While some commentaries on the pandemic have the premise that all countries failed to respond well to the pandemic the exact opposite stands out to us: Even at this early stage of the pandemic we see very large differences between countries &#x2013; as the chart shows. While some suffer terrible outbreaks others have managed to contain rapid outbreaks or even prevented bad outbreaks entirely.

That is because the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 are so extraordinarily large.</p><p>Once a country experiences a rapid outbreak of the disease it can only respond with one of two bad alternatives: leaving the pandemic unchecked would mean that a very large share of the population would get sick and many would die. But the <em>indirect impacts</em> that result from the alternative &#x2013; the containment measures of shutting down public life &#x2013; also lead to widespread suffering: these include higher unemployment, lower production (and therefore increasing rates of poverty), and likely also higher mortality from other causes.</p><p>To properly monitor the impact of the pandemic we would need <strong>metrics that are unfortunately not available:</strong> the total number of deaths due COVID-19 and the metrics that capture the many ways the pandemic indirectly impacts our lives.</p><p>The goal of researchers &#x2013; in our team and elsewhere &#x2013; is to work towards these ideal measures. In the meantime we have to learn from <strong>the metrics that are available currently:</strong> the number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19, excess mortality, and the early results of the ongoing research on the pandemic&#x2019;s indirect impacts.</p><p>To capture both of these are ongoing efforts of our work. Here at <em>Our World in Data</em> we aim to provide a broad perspective on the living conditions of people around the world &#x2013; from poverty, to education, to human rights, and health more broadly &#x2013; look at<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/#entries"> the full list</a> of the topics we work on.

It is therefore <em>the entire world</em> that needs to make progress against the virus if we want to prevent a situation where countries either need to lock themselves off from the rest of the world or suffer recurring COVID-19 outbreaks.</p><p>Only if we end the pandemic everywhere can the pandemic end anywhere.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-chart-to-monitor-the-fight-against-the-global-pandemic"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-chart-to-monitor-the-fight-against-the-global-pandemic"></a>The chart to monitor the fight against the global pandemic</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>If the <em>total</em> number of cases was known it would be straightforward to build a good visualization to monitor the pandemic. We would simply report new cases over time &#x2013; a chart that the literature refers to as the <em>epidemic curve,</em> often shortened to <em>epi curve</em>.</p>



<p>However, with the COVID-19 pandemic we are in the unfortunate situation that the number of total cases is not known. Only a fraction of total cases &#x2013; those confirmed by a test &#x2013; is known.</p>



<p>This means that we need to be able to monitor the number of confirmed cases and the testing that a country does. Because no academically sound organization built a database on testing we here at Our World in Data spend much of our work on building the required international testing database that allows us to make sense of the available counts of confirmed cases.</p>



<p>Below we will explain in more detail what we can learn from this chart, but the quick summary of this chart is that each line in this chart shows you the new confirmed cases over time &#x2013; that part of the chart is simply the classic epi curve &#x2013; while the line color shows you the quality of the data at each point in time: the rate of tests that are positive. Darker shades of blue indicate a low positive rate, which means that a country is testing very widely so that the confirmed case count is likely closer to the true total number of cases.</p>



<p>The chart allows everyone to monitor whether the world is successful in the fight against the pandemic: what the world needs to achieve is that all lines turn into dark blue and hit zero.</p>

<h5>How you can interact with this chart</h5>



<ul><li>Clicking on any country in the chart highlights that country. If you click on several countries you can create a view in which you can compare several countries.</li><li>Any country you might not see immediately you can find via the <strong>&#x2018;Select Countries&#x2019;</strong> in the bottom left. Just type the name in the search box there.</li><li>To focus on the countries you highlighted click on &#x2018;Zoom to selection&#x2019;.</li><li>The default view on a logarithmic y-axis is helpful to compare the growth rates between countries: on a logarithmic axis the steepness of the line corresponds to the growth rate. [<a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/">Here</a> is an explanation for how to read logarithmic axes.]</li><li>But in this chart &#x2013; as in many of our charts &#x2013; you can switch to a linear axis &#x2013; just click on &#x2018;Linear&#x2019; in the top left.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why are not all countries included in this chart?</strong></p>



<ul><li>For a country to be included in this chart, we require data on testing for this country (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing">here</a> is our testing database &#x2013; all sources are documented there and we report for which countries we were not able to find testing data.)</li><li>If you are interested in the number of confirmed cases for a country not shown here, have a look at<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?yScale=log&amp;zoomToSelection=true&amp;casesMetric=true&amp;dailyFreq=true&amp;smoothing=7&amp;country=USA~CAN~BRA~AUS~IND~DEU~MEX~ZAF~DZA~COL~IDN~ETH~NGA~CHL~KEN"> the Data Explorer</a>, you&#x2019;ll find the data there.</li></ul>

<p>Just as it is not informative to look at case counts in isolation it is also not informative to look at the number of tests in isolation. We need to see the number of tests in relation to the size of the outbreak: countries with large outbreaks need to do much more testing to monitor the spread of the pandemic than countries where the disease is under control. See<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing-us-uk-korea-italy"> the work</a> of our colleague Joe Hasell who looked at this in detail.</p>



<p>Based on this principle we calculate a quality metric for the case counts that answers the question: what share of tests in a particular country confirm a case of COVID-19?&#xA0;</p>



<p>This metric is referred to as the positive rate or positivity rate.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p>The world map here shows this data &#x2013; it is exactly the same data shown as the line color in the chart above.</p>



<p>By moving the time-line below the map you can see how this metric has changed around the world; by clicking on a country you can see how it changed in every country.</p>



<p>The world map shows enormous differences across countries:</p>



<ul><li>Some countries, like Australia, South Korea and Slovenia do hundreds, or even thousands of tests for each case they find &#x2013; the positive rate of these countries is therefore below 1% or even 0.1%.</li><li>Others, such as Mexico, Nigeria, and Bangladesh do very few tests &#x2013; five or fewer &#x2013; for every confirmed case. Their positive rate is very high.</li></ul>



<p>Countries that do very few tests per confirmed case are unlikely to be testing widely enough to find all cases. The WHO has suggested a positive rate lower than 10% &#x2013; but better lower than 3% &#x2013; as a general benchmark of adequate testing.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>



<p>The countries that have a positive rate below 3% are shown in shades of blue. Those that have a positive rate higher than 5% are shown in shades of red.</p>



<p>In countries that test very little in relation to their outbreak &#x2013; shown in shades of red in the chart &#x2013; many cases are likely to go unreported. In these countries, the number of confirmed cases indicated may represent only a fraction of the total number of cases.</p>



<p>Only countries for which we have data on testing are included in this world map (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing">here</a> is our testing database &#x2013; all sources are documented there and we report for which countries we were not able to find testing data.)</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Before we get into how to make progress against the virus, let&#x2019;s think about what we need to avoid.</p>



<p>The very worst that can happen are rapid outbreaks that lead to many people being infected in the same area <em>at the same time</em>.</p>



<p>A doctor can help 10,000 patients one after the other, but a doctor can not help 10,000 patients when they are all sick at the same time. A large number of sick people can exceed the capacity of the healthcare system (as the illustration shows).</p>



<p>When this becomes a reality many die untreated. And as more healthcare workers get sick themselves, the capacity of healthcare systems declines at just the time when it is most needed.</p>



<p>Unfortunately this has already happened several times during the pandemic: the need for healthcare was much greater than what the system was able to offer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Italy#Healthcare">North of Italy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Spain#Healthcare_system">Madrid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_York_City">New York City</a>, and several other places around the world.</p>



<p>Without adequate countermeasures the rate of infection is high and the disease spreads very rapidly as we&#x2019;ve seen in these places.</p>



<p>In these times the risk for all patients, not just COVID-19 patients, can be much higher than normal. Patients who suffer from common <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death">causes of death</a> &#x2013; like cancers or cardiovascular diseases &#x2013; might no longer be able to access their regular care. And others might postpone seeing a doctor because their are afraid to get infected with COVID-19 and thereby miss a diagnosis. The ensuing increase of deaths is what the statistics on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid">excess mortality</a> capture.</p>

And as explained above the best way to contribute to this goal is to not get infected yourself &#x2013; by washing your hands, wearing a mask, and watching your distance.</p><p>Beyond the individual level we can join forces to achieve even more. Cooperation is the strength of our species and our most promising strategy to make progress against the pandemic is the global collaboration in science, technology, and political organization.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="1-science-and-medical-innovation"><a class="deep-link" href="#1-science-and-medical-innovation"></a>1] Science and medical innovation</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Humanity made a lot of progress against big problems before &#x2013; if you have doubts, read our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-living-conditions-in-5-charts">Short History of Global Living Conditions</a>.</p><p>Innovation &#x2013; our collaborative success in research and development &#x2013; were often key to our success. Scientific breakthroughs made it possible to make decisive progress against problems that seemed insurmountable before. &#x201C;Science is the only news,&#x201D; as Stewart Brand put it.</p><p>Big innovations now could make all the difference between a pandemic that spreads around the globe and requires us to live a life in constant worry of new outbreaks or the possibility that we find the technological innovation to protect ourselves from the virus.&#xA0;</p><p>In recent decades humanity has been extraordinarily successful in the fight against viruses and bacteria &#x2013; we found vaccines against diseases that once killed millions every year, we reduced child mortality around the world, and in every region of the world we now live twice as long as our ancestors just a few generations ago. In this pandemic too, we can hope &#x2013; but not expect &#x2013; that science comes to the rescue.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="vaccines-antivirals-and-treatments"><a class="deep-link" href="#vaccines-antivirals-and-treatments"></a>Vaccines, antivirals and treatments</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The biggest game changer would be an effective and safe vaccine against COVID19. </p><p>Why is a vaccine so important?</p><p>The pandemic will come to an end when the world population has immunity against the disease. Not the entire world population needs to be immune, but a sufficiently large fraction, this is the &#x2018;herd immunity threshold&#x2019;.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>The question is how this immunity threshold will be reached. There are two ways:</p><ul><li>One possible future is that more and more people get infected with the virus and thereby acquire immunity against future infections. This will likely take a long time and it obviously involves many people getting sick and dying from the disease.</li><li>The alternative is to acquire this immunity of large share of the population through a vaccine instead of people getting sick with the disease.</li></ul><p>Until there is a vaccine more and more people will contract the disease and the rapid rise of cases will only come to an end when the world population has reached the immunity threshold in this natural way. This &#x2018;natural way&#x2019; of immunizing the world population will involve a large number of deaths and constant individual protection and political responses with the goal outlined above: reducing the rate of infection so that not too many people contract the disease at the same time.</p><p>The development of a safe vaccine holds the promise that we can avoid this future.</p><h5>We are on the way to a vaccine against COVID-19 &#x2013; several <em>Vaccine Trackers</em> monitor the progress:</h5><p>The problem is that it is hard to develop vaccines; it&#x2019;s costly and it takes a lot of time. We have previously looked into the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#vaccine-innovation">history of vaccine development</a><strong>. </strong>The measles vaccine was found relatively rapidly: it took only 10 years from the discovery of the pathogen to the development of the first vaccine. But for typhoid it took more than a century, and for some diseases for which we know the pathogens for more than a century (like malaria) we still haven&#x2019;t found an effective vaccine.</p><p>The hope is that for COVID-19 we will beat all previous records and get to a safe vaccine much faster than ever before.&#xA0;</p><p>Several institutions maintain the websites in which they list COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being developed:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines"><em>WHO Vaccine Tracker</em></a> &#x2013; The WHO is tracking the COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are under development here.</li><li><a href="https://www.covid-19vaccinetracker.org/"><em>Milken Institute Vaccine Tracker</em></a> &#x2013; The Milken Institute publishes &#x2013; and regularly updates &#x2013; a tracker of possible treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 that scientists are currently working on.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></li><li><a href="https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_vaccine_landscape/">London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine Vaccine Tracker</a> &#x2013; The LSHTM tracker is updated weekly and shows the current stage of each development.</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">New York Times</a> &#x2013; The NYT tracker includes brief summaries of each development.</li></ul></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="2-data-and-research"><a class="deep-link" href="#2-data-and-research"></a>2] Data and research</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Without data we would have no chance to respond appropriately to the pandemic.

<p>The nine metrics used to calculate the Government Stringency Index are: school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; closures of public transport; stay-at-home requirements; public information campaigns; restrictions on internal movements; and international travel controls.</p>



<p>The map here presents this metric. By clicking on any country you can how the response has changed in each country over time.</p>

Our way of calculating the rate here is slightly different. It is calculated as the number of confirmed cases (i.e. people with a positive result) divided by either the number of people tested, or by the number of tests performed. These differ because people may be tested more than once. Countries vary in which test count they report.

It is possible that a share of the population already has some form of immunity – in this case this share of the population would already get us closer to the required threshold.
