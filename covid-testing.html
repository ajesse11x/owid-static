Without testing we have no way of understanding the pandemic.</p><p>It is one of our most important tools in the fight to slow and reduce the spread and impact of the virus. Tests allow us to identify infected individuals, guiding the medical treatment that they receive. It enables the isolation of those infected and the tracing and quarantining of their contacts.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> And it can help allocate medical resources and staff more efficiently.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>In addition, testing for COVID-19 also informs our understanding of the pandemic and the risks it poses in different populations.</p><p>This knowledge is important if we are to properly assess the interventions that should be implemented, including very costly interventions such as social distancing and the shutdown of entire regions and industries.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19"><a class="deep-link" href="#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19"></a>Different types of tests for COVID-19</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>There are two kinds of tests for COVID-19:</p><ul><li>those that test for the presence of the virus, aiming to establish whether an individual is currently infected;</li><li>those that test for the presence of antibodies, aiming to establish whether an individual has been infected at some point in the past.</li></ul><p>The testing data we present below relates to the former kind of test. The most common way of performing a test of this type is with a &#x2018;PCR&#x2019; test. Here you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM">a video</a> that explains how this kind of test works.</p><p>The second kind of test &#x2013; serological tests &#x2013; are generally still in the research stage of development. This kind of test will be central to establishing how far the coronavirus has spread across the broader population. The Centre for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University provide up to date information on serology tests that are <a href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/COVID-19/serology/Serology-based-tests-for-COVID-19.html#sec2">in development or available for use</a> &#x2013; whether for diagnosis, or only for research purposes.A helpful summary of the current state of testing technologies and their implementation &#x2013; as of 8 April &#x2013; can be found in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-0553-6">this editorial</a> published in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="why-data-on-testing-is-needed"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-data-on-testing-is-needed"></a>Why data on testing is needed</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Without data on COVID-19 we cannot possibly understand how the pandemic is progressing.</p><p>Without data we cannot respond appropriately to the threat; neither as individuals nor as a society.

Clear answers to these questions are what is needed to properly interpret and compare published numbers.</p><p>For citizens to trust and understand the published data and for countries to learn from each other, it is crucial that every country provides the data on testing in a clearly documented way. We hope this checklist offers helpful guidance.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data"></a>Our checklist for COVID-19 testing data</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p><strong>1) Is there no data &#x2013; or it is just hard to find?</strong></p><p>Many countries are not yet providing official figures. Others do not do so on a regular basis. The first question to ask, then, is if there is any testing data for a given country.</p><p>Equally important is to make the available data findable. Currently, the available data is often not easy to find, because some countries are releasing figures at unpredictable intervals in ad-hoc locations (including social media or press conferences).</p><p><strong>2) Do numbers refer to &#x2018;performed tests&#x2019; or &#x2018;individuals tested&#x2019;?</strong></p><p>The number of tests performed is different to the number of individuals tested. The reason for this is that it is common for COVID-19 testing that the same person is tested more than once.</p><p>Some countries report tests performed, while others report the number of individuals tested.</p><p>The source description should state clearly what is counted.</p><p><strong>3) Are negative results included? Are pending results included?</strong></p><p>It needs to be clear whether or not figures for the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested, include negative test results, as well as the number of tests that are pending results.</p><p>Many sources report the number of individuals who are &#x2018;suspected&#x2019; or have been &#x2018;ruled out&#x2019;. To be reliably included in test counts, it needs to be explicit whether such categories reflect the number of people who are awaiting test results or have tested negatively.</p><p><strong>4) Do the figures include all tests conducted in the country, or only some?&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Figures reported by countries may only be partial if not all laboratories are reporting to the central authority.</p><p>The scope of testing data should be made explicit by the source. For instance, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html">US CDC</a> make it clear that their figures do not include tests conducted in private labs.</p><p><strong>5) Are all regions and laboratories within a country submitting data on the same basis?</strong></p><p>Answers to the questions above may vary from region to region. In order to assess the reliability of aggregate testing data, it needs to be clear if heterogenous data is being summed together.</p><p>The <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/">US COVID Tracking Project</a>, for instance makes it clear that their US totals combine data for tests performed and individuals tested, depending on which is reported by individual states.</p><p><strong>6) What period do the published figures refer to?</strong></p><p>Cumulative counts of the total number of tests should make clear the date from which the count begins. The key question that needs to be answered is whether the figures published at some date (attempt to) include all tests conducted up to that date.</p><p>Because the reporting of tests can take several days, for some countries figures for the last few days may not yet be complete. It needs to be made clear by the source if this may be the case. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html">US CDC</a>, for instance, makes this clear.</p><p><strong>7) Are there any issues that affect the comparability of the data over time?</strong></p><p>If we want to look at how testing figures are changing over time, we need to know how any of the factors discussed above may have changed too.</p><p><a href="https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus/covid-19/informatie-voor-professionals/virologische-dagstaten">The Netherlands</a>, for instance, makes it clear that not all labs were included in national estimates from the start. As new labs get included, their past cumulative total gets added to the day they begin reporting, creating spikes in the time series.</p><p><strong>8) What are the typical testing practices in the country?</strong></p><p>Having a sense of how often and when individuals are tested, can help the users of these statistics understand how estimates of tests performed and individuals tested might relate to each other.</p><p>For instance, how many tests does a case investigation require? What are the eligibility criteria to be tested? Are health workers, or other specific groups, being routinely retested?</p><p><strong>9) Might any of the information above be lost in translation?</strong></p><p>People accessing data published in a language in which they are not fluent may misinterpret the data by mistranslating the provided text, which often includes technical terms.</p><p>Many countries report testing data in multiple languages &#x2013; this helps disseminate the information to a broader audience, whilst helping prevent misinterpretations.<br></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="our-database-on-covid-19-testing-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#our-database-on-covid-19-testing-data"></a>Our database on COVID-19 testing data</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Our goal at Our World in Data is to provide testing data over time for many countries around the world.</p><p>We have started with this effort and will expand it in the coming days.</p><p>Our aim is to provide alongside the data a good understanding of the definitions used and any important limitations they might have.

This gives us an indication of the scale of testing that accounts for the different stages each country may be in its outbreak.</p><p>The bar chart shows the number of tests, or people tested per confirmed case.

The dotted comparison lines show the points on the chart where the number of tests are a fixed number of times larger than the number of confirmed cases &#x2013; 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 times larger.</p><p>In terms of testing coverage the UK appears to be ahead of Taiwan, with at least twice the number of people tested per thousand, as of 11 April.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>But on the same date, there were <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-confirmed-cases-of-covid-19-per-million-people?tab=chart&amp;country=TWN+GBR">60 times</a> more confirmed cases per million in the UK than in Taiwan &#x2013; 1,035 per million and 16 cases per million respectively.&#xA0;</p><p>So whilst testing relative to population size is higher in the UK, testing <em>relative to the</em> <em>size of the outbreak</em> is much, much higher in Taiwan.</p><p>As of 11 April, in Taiwan one case was confirmed for every 120 tests. In the UK, a case was confirmed in fewer than every four tests.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>In Australia, testing coverage is much higher than in Taiwan. But in terms of the number of tests per confirmed case, the countries are much closer &#x2013; one case was confirmed for every 55 tests in Australia as of 11 April. A number of issues with the data on testing &#x2013; discussed <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing">here</a> &#x2013; mean that small differences between countries should not be overinterpreted.</p><p>But the very large differences &#x2013; such as those seen between Taiwan, Australia and the UK &#x2013; do tell us something important about the quality of the data.</p><p>A country that performs very few tests for each case it confirms is not testing widely enough for the number of confirmed cases to paint a reliable picture of the true spread of the virus. Whilst those people with the most severe symptoms may have been tested in such countries, there are likely to be many times more people with mild or no symptoms that were never tested.</p><p>Testing in the UK has not kept pace with the advancing outbreak. The number of people tested per confirmed case <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-tests-cases-scatter-with-comparisons?time=1..81&amp;country=TWN+GBR">fell rapidly</a> throughout March and early April &#x2013; from more than 400, to less than 4. The current low level of testing, relative to the size of the outbreak, suggests that the true number of infections in the UK is likely to be far higher than the number of confirmed cases.</p><p>The large number of tests for each confirmed case in Taiwan and Australia suggests that the number of confirmed cases paint a much more reliable picture of the true number of infections in these countries.</p><p>Researchers from the <em>London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</em> &#x2013; Timothy Russel, Joel Hellewell, Sam Abbott and others &#x2013; reach similar conclusions about the UK and Australia via a different method.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> They estimate the degree to which countries&#x2019; confirmed cases may underestimate total symptomatic cases by applying the case fatality rate (we explain this metric in detail <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#what-do-we-know-about-the-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19">here</a>) observed in large studies in China and South Korea to data on the number of COVID-19 deaths in countries around the world.</p><p>They estimate that in Australia the number of confirmed cases reflect more than three quarters of the total number of symptomatic cases in the country. For the UK, they estimate that confirmed cases represent less than one in twenty symptomatic cases.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>As such, the gap between the UK and Australia in terms of the true number of infections is likely to be far higher than that indicated by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-cases-covid-19?country=AUS+TWN+GBR">their confirmed cases</a>.</p><p>The intuition behind these researchers&#x2019; estimates is that where the number of confirmed cases looks low against the number of deaths, this is a clear indication that the true number of cases is likely to be much, much higher. But the fundamental reason for this is the limited extent of testing.</p><p>The rate of tests per case thus gives us another useful way of approaching the same question, by looking at the extent of testing relative to the number of cases directly.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-tests-cases-scatter-with-comparisons?country=AUS+TWN+GBR" class="grapherPreview">

This is likely (the Government of Canada website does not make the reasoning clear, only publishes a slightly different format of table) the result of a large backlog of tests waiting to be processed. This makes the data misleading to use in time-series format prior to 18th March. We therefore only use data from 18th March onwards for comparability.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=CAN" class="grapherPreview">

We have copied this time-series as presented in the original source. It&#x2019;s important to note that when figures exceed 1000, the Finnish Department of Health and Welfare report samples to the nearest hundred (e.g. 1.6k). <br><br>From the available documention we cannot be entirely certain whether &#x2018;samples tested&#x2019; refers to the number of tests or number of people tested, given the general ambiguity in the usage of these terms internationally. However, a literal interpretation of the figures as the number of samples tested is consistent with further descriptions of the testing data provided <a href="https://thl.fi/fi/web/infektiotaudit-ja-rokotukset/ajankohtaista/ajankohtaista-koronaviruksesta-covid-19/tilannekatsaus-koronaviruksesta">here</a>.<br><br>The data description notes that tests are being rationed and allocated according to the following strategy: &#x201C;Samples are taken primarily from patients with severe symptoms of respiratory infection and from health and social care staff to ensure staff health and labor adequacy&#x2026;.Attention has also been paid to vulnerable groups of patients with some underlying disease and to those over 70 years of age.&#x201D;<br><br>This data series extends to the 27th February, when test figures were very low (9 tests per day).

<strong>Short description: </strong>The testing figures are labelled as &#x2018;number of tests&#x2019; in the source, but as of 2 April we are unsure of the right interpretation of the units.</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>7.05 per thousand people; 463,662 in total (as of 14 April 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>The source publishes epidemiological updates at irregular intervals. The latest update, as of 18th April, was published on the 16h April. The updates include a figure for the number of tests (&#x2018;Nombre de tests&#x2019;). However the context in which the figures are published suggests that these numbers may actually refer to the number of individuals tested. A breakdown into positive and negative results are given, along with a positive test rate.<br><br>Such a breakdown seems counter-intuitive if the figures relate to the number of tests performed rather than the number of individuals tested. In the former case, it would mean that the tests from people who had two two tests &#x2013; e.g. both positive &#x2013; would be added to tests of people who had five tests &#x2013; e.g. three negative and two positive.<br><br>The figures in the time series relate to tests performed since 24 February. In the 24 March update, in addition to the previously reported hospital tests, laboratory tests are also reported. Only the total number of laboratory tests performed between 24 February and 24 March is presented, without a time series. Our figure for 24 March adds the cumulative number of laboratory tests since 24 February (6,500) to the hospital tests figure (101,046). As such 24 March represents a break in the series.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=FRA" class="grapherPreview">

<strong>Short description: </strong>The number of tests performed.

However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.<br><br>The report published on 8 April states that &#x201C;from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 14/2020&#x201D;:<br>&#x2013; The cumulative total of samples tested was 1,317,887;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 143 labs reported 392,984 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 149 labs reported 360,964 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348619 samples tested;<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127457 samples tested.<br>&#x2013; For calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 48 labs reported 87,863 samples tested.<br><br>By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.<br><br>Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=DEU" class="grapherPreview">

<strong>Short description: </strong>The number of tests performed.</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>22.08 per thousand people; 1,305,833 in total (as of 18 April 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>The official data provided by the Ministry of Health is compiled by the Department of Civil Protection on <a href="https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19">GitHub</a>. Figures relate to &#x2018;Tamponi&#x2019; (the number of &#x2018;swabs&#x2019; tested) conducted in all labs across Italy. This figure is available for each individual region separately at the source indicated. However it appears that data is missing for individual regions for particular dates &#x2013; we assume that these are also missing from the aggregate total for Italy that we provide. The list of missing data, in English, can be seen at the bottom of <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/91350339-2c97-49b5-92b8-965996530f00/page/RdlHB">this data dashboard built by Franco Mossotto</a>. <br><br>It is clear that there are delays in timeline running up to a test being reported &#x2013; both in terms of the time it takes for a symptomatic person to receive a test, and in the time for that test to then get reported in the data. For one region, Lombardy, an investigation found the latter delay to be around 3-4 days.<br><br>It is unclear whether the figures include tests pending results. But given that the stock of total tests to date is large relative to the daily number of tests, this is unlikely to affect the numbers materially.<br><br>There is significant variation in testing practices &#x2013; in terms of how many tests are conducted and how they are allocated across the population &#x2013; across regions and these practices have also changed over time.<br><br>Pietro Monticone and Riccardo Valperga have written a very helpful and detailed description of these data quality issues <a href="https://pitmonticone.github.io/covid-italy/owid-testing-italy.html">here in GitHub</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=ITA" class="grapherPreview">

Rather than providing a full time series, each release provides daily test figures for a handful of the most recent days and then shows the cumulative total prior to that. It appears that figures are retrospectively updated, because the chain of daily figures from previous releases does not perfectly agree with the cumulative total reported in subsequent releases (though the discrepancies are relatively small).<br><br>Available to us are those reports retrievable through Web Archive. The earliest is from 26 March. A report for everyday since then could not be retreived. We construct our series taking the cumulative total as reported in the most recent report, and adding the daily figures available in the most recent report. The daily tesing figures we provide are calculated based on the change in the this cumulative figure we contruct. As such they may disagree slightly with the figures published in earlier releases.<br><br>The source reports the number of labs reporting in a given daily or cumulative figure. These have varied over the course of the reports, and this will affect the consistency of the time series we present.<br><br>The earliest figure we have is a cumulative total (reported on the 26 March) for the 14 March. The release states that &#x2018;all laboratories in the Netherlands that perform diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 have been asked from 9 March report these data daily.&#x2019; The figure given notes that 24 labs were counted in this cumulative figure. More recent releases count around 35 labs in the cumulative totals provided. But there appear to be reporting lags &#x2013; the number of labs reporting for the latest one or two days are a good deal lower than for previous days.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=NLD" class="grapherPreview">

This information includes demographic information of confirmed cases.<br><br>These daily reports state the cumulative number of people who have been tested &#x2013; including the number and share who tested positive. We can use these daily updates to construct a full time-series. Note that the source states that &#x201C;Changes in test criteria may&#x2026; have resulted in slightly fewer tests tested per day. Data for the last few days is incomplete and will be updated.&#x201D;  They also note that &#x201C;The figure contains only numbers from laboratories that have reports that include the sampling date. &#x201C;[via Google Translate].<br><br>In addition to the aggregate number of people tested, the source provides a regional breakdown, in which it is noted that tests in &#x2018;private labs that analyze tests across the country&#x2019; are excluded. The sum of this breakdown is lower than the aggregate figure provided. We take this as an indication that the main aggregate figure we report includes all private testing.<br><br>Daily reports with figures on testing are only available dating back to 16th March. We therefore do not know the first date of testing, only that as of 16th March, 18062 people had been tested.<br><br>The total number of people quoted to have been tested in each daily report refers to those tested up until 3pm (local time) of the previous day.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=NOR" class="grapherPreview">

This previous breakdown of the test results and COVID-19 dashboard have both been removed. We became aware of this new tracker on the 13th April with data &#x2018;as of April 11 2020, 12am&#x2019;.

These figures reflect the total number of positive and negative test results, excluding pending results.

We have cross-checked a sample of the figures reported in this unofficial source against the original tweets.<br><br>It is possible that the figures tweeted by the Ministry of Health are equivalent to the number of people tested, since the number of positive samples reported tend to be equal to the number of infected persons that the ministry reports in other tweets in the same day. However, since the ministry uses the language &#x201C;number of samples tested&#x201D; (&#x201C;liczba przebadanych pr&#xF3;bek&#x201D;) in its tweets that report testing figures, we interpret the units as &#x201C;sample tested&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;people tested&#x201D;.<br><br>The first date for which we have found data is March 6th 2020, in which 855 cumulative samples were tested since an unknown date.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=POL" class="grapherPreview">

It is unclear whether this relates to the number of individuals tested, or the number of samples tested.</p><p><strong>Latest estimate: </strong>2.2 per thousand people; 52,445 in total (as of 17 April 2020).</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br><br>The Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control (CDC) host a dashboard in which they publish the total &#x2018;tested&#x2019; to date, and &#x2018;new from yesterday&#x2019;. It is not clear whether this represents the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested. The number &#x2018;tested&#x2019; is greater than the sum of confirmed cases and &#x2018;excluded&#x2019; (i.e. negative) test results. This would suggest it does not equal the total number of people tested, or if it does, pending results without a reported outcome are also included.<br><br>Although the CDC only show the last day&#x2019;s figures on this dashboard, we can construct a time-series by looking at previous versions on web archive. Where possible we have tried to take the total test counts at the same time every day (those published at 00:30h). Unfortunately this time of publishing from CDC was not always completely consistent. This may lead to small discrepancies between &#x2018;total tested&#x2019; and &#x2018;new from &#x2018;yesterday&#x2019; figures. Wherever possible we took the total test count as of 00:30 as the prefered figure; where a day of data was missing we used the &#x2018;new from yesterday&#x2019; figure to calculate the total for the previous day. If there are small discrepancies with other sources, this timing issue is likely to be the cause. In any case it is likely to be minor.<br><br>The date from which the total test figures date back to is not known; the CDC dashboard is unavailable in web archives prior to 21st March.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/full-list-cumulative-total-tests-per-thousand?country=TWN" class="grapherPreview">

The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.<br><br>Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.<br><br>The Project documents their work in lots of detail.
