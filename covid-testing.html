Nor can we learn where countermeasures against the pandemic are working.&#xA0;</p><p>The number of confirmed cases is what informs us about the development of the pandemic.</p><p>But the confirmation of a case is based on a test. The World Health Organization defines a confirmed case as &#x201C;a person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection&#x201D;.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Reliable data on testing is therefore necessary to assess the reliability of the data that informs us about the spread of the pandemic: the data on cases and deaths.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="some-countries-provide-clear-and-helpful-data-on-testing"><a class="deep-link" href="#some-countries-provide-clear-and-helpful-data-on-testing"></a>Some countries provide clear and helpful data on testing</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Some countries present comprehensive, detailed and regularly updated data. Iceland (<a href="https://www.covid.is/data">here</a>) is one of these countries. Estonia (<a href="https://www.terviseamet.ee/et/koroonaviirus/koroonakaart">here</a>) goes even further, showing breakdowns by age, gender and region.</p><p>For many countries however, available data on testing is either incomplete or else completely unavailable. This makes it impossible for their citizens and for researchers to assess the extent and significance of their testing efforts.&#xA0;</p><p>Our current knowledge of COVID-19 testing &#x2013; and more importantly of the pandemic itself &#x2013; would be greatly improved if all countries were able to report all the testing data available to them in the way shown by the best examples.&#xA0;</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="we-need-to-understand-what-the-published-numbers-on-testing-mean"><a class="deep-link" href="#we-need-to-understand-what-the-published-numbers-on-testing-mean"></a>We need to understand what the published numbers on testing mean&#xA0;</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Those countries that do publish testing data often do not provide the required documentation to make it clear what the provided numbers precisely mean, and this is crucial for meaningful comparisons between countries and over time.</p><p>The key questions that any data description on testing data should answer are given in the following checklist. Clear answers to these questions are what is needed to properly interpret and compare published numbers.</p><p>For citizens to trust and understand the published data and for countries to learn from each other, it is crucial that every country provides the data on testing in a clearly documented way. We hope this checklist offers helpful guidance.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data"></a>Our checklist for COVID-19 testing data</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p><strong>1) Is there any data?</strong></p><p>Many countries are not yet providing official figures. Others do not do so on a regular basis. The first question to ask, then, is if there is any testing data for a given country.</p><p>Equally important is to make the available data findable. Currently, the available data is often not easy to find, because some countries are releasing figures at unpredictable intervals in ad-hoc locations (including social media or press conferences).</p><p><strong>2) Do numbers refer to &#x2018;performed tests&#x2019; or &#x2018;individuals tested&#x2019;?</strong></p><p>The number of tests performed is different to the number of individuals tested. The reason for this is that it is common for COVID-19 testing that the same person is tested more than once.</p><p>Some countries report tests performed, while others report the number of individuals tested.</p><p>The source description should state clearly what is counted.</p><p><strong>3) Are negative results included? Are pending results included?</strong></p><p>It needs to be clear whether or not figures for the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested, include negative test results, as well as the number of tests that are pending results.</p><p>Many sources report the number of individuals who are &#x2018;suspected&#x2019; or have been &#x2018;ruled out&#x2019;. To be reliably included in test counts, it needs to be explicit whether such categories reflect the number of people who are awaiting test results or have tested negatively.</p><p><strong>4) Do the figures include all tests conducted in the country, or only some?&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Figures reported by countries may only be partial if not all laboratories are reporting to the central authority.</p><p>The scope of testing data should be made explicit by the source. For instance, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html">US CDC</a> make it clear that their figures do not include tests conducted in private labs.</p><p><strong>5) Are all regions and laboratories within a country submitting data on the same basis?</strong></p><p>Answers to the questions above may vary from region to region. In order to assess the reliability of aggregate testing data, it needs to be clear if heterogenous data is being summed together.</p><p>The <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/">US COVID Tracking Project</a>, for instance makes it clear that their US totals combine data for tests performed and individuals tested, depending on which is reported by individual states.</p><p><strong>6) What period do the published figures refer to?</strong></p><p>Cumulative counts of the total number of tests should make clear the date from which the count begins. The key question that needs to be answered is whether the figures published at some date (attempt to) include all tests conducted up to that date.</p><p>Because the reporting of tests can take several days, for some countries figures for the last few days may not yet be complete. It needs to be made clear by the source if this may be the case. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html">US CDC</a>, for instance, makes this clear.</p><p><strong>7) Are there any issues that affect the comparability of the data over time?</strong></p><p>If we want to look at how testing figures are changing over time, we need to know how any of the factors discussed above may have changed too.</p><p><a href="https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus/covid-19/informatie-voor-professionals/virologische-dagstaten">The Netherlands</a>, for instance, makes it clear that not all labs were included in national estimates from the start. As new labs get included, their past cumulative total gets added to the day they begin reporting, creating spikes in the time series.</p><p><strong>8) What are the typical testing practices in the country?</strong></p><p>Having a sense of how often and when individuals are tested, can help the users of these statistics understand how estimates of tests performed and individuals tested might relate to each other.</p><p>For instance, how many tests does a case investigation require? What are the eligibility criteria to be tested? Are health workers, or other specific groups, being routinely retested?</p><p><strong>9) Might any of the information above be lost in translation?</strong></p><p>People accessing data published in a language in which they are not fluent may misinterpret the data by mistranslating the provided text, which often includes technical terms.</p><p>Many countries report testing data in multiple languages &#x2013; this helps disseminate the information to a broader audience, whilst helping prevent misinterpretations.<br></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="our-database-on-covid-19-testing-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#our-database-on-covid-19-testing-data"></a>Our database on COVID-19 testing data</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Our goal at Our World in Data is to provide testing data over time for many countries around the world.</p><p>We have started with this effort and will expand it in the coming days.</p><p>Our aim is to provide alongside the data a good understanding of the definitions used and any important limitations they might have.
