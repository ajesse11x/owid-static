This can help them receive the care they need; and it can help them take measures to reduce the probability of infecting others. People who don&#x2019;t know they are infected might not stay at home and thereby risk infecting others.</p><p>Testing is also crucial for an appropriate response to the pandemic. It allows us to understand the spread of the disease and to take evidence-based measures to slow down the spread of the disease.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Unfortunately, the capacity for COVID-19 testing is still low in many countries around the world. For this reason we still do not have a good understanding of the spread of the pandemic.</p><p>To understand the impact of COVID-19, we need to know things like how easily it spreads, and how dangerous it is for people who have it. So that means we need to know how many people are infected. That&#x2019;s difficult, because the disease can look a lot like other illnesses, like flu, and in some people the symptoms are very mild.&#xA0;</p><p>To understand how infectious the disease is, and how dangerous, we need to test people to see if they have it. For instance, if you know that 100 people have died from it, it makes a difference whether that&#x2019;s out of 1,000 people who have had the disease, or 100,000. The best way to fight against a disease that spreads very easily but doesn&#x2019;t kill many of those infected is very different to the best way to fight against a disease that spreads more slowly but is more deadly.</p><p>Also, testing allows infected people to get the care they need and to take precautions. If they don&#x2019;t know they&#x2019;re infected, they might not stay home, and put other people at risk.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, testing lets healthcare workers identify people with the disease, and help isolate them and the people they&#x2019;ve been in contact with.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>Unfortunately, many countries still don&#x2019;t have enough capacity for COVID-19 testing.

We&#x2019;d like to know what the results of these tests are, and how the available tests are being used &#xA0;&#x2013; are countries testing only people in hospitals? People with symptoms?</p><p>Unfortunately, the WHO does not have a centralized database for COVID-19 testing data, so at the moment it is very hard to know.</p><p>That said, several countries do publish statistics on the total number of tests performed.  But these reports are published across individual websites, statistical reports and press releases &#x2013; often in multiple languages and updated with different periodicity.</p><p>Because a global overview was not available from a single source, at Our World in Data we are bringing together a large number of data sources from individual national reports, in order to provide a global picture with the best available estimates.</p><p>Below we show the most recent data <strong>as of 20 March 2020, 18.00 GMT</strong>. This requires a lot of careful work, but we will do our best to expand and update these estimates regularly.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="total-tests-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#total-tests-by-country"></a>Total tests by country</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>These two charts show the most up-to-date estimates of testing levels that we&#x2019;ve been able to find (<strong>as of 20 March 2020, 18.00 GMT</strong>). You&#x2019;ll see that some countries&#x2019; data is older than others, meaning that they can&#x2019;t be directly compared. For instance, the estimate for the province of Guangdong in China has not been updated since 24 February.</p><p>The first chart plots the total number of tests against the total number of confirmed cases. The more tests a country has done the higher it is; the more confirmed cases it has, the further it is to the right.</p><p>Naturally, since you can only get a positive test if you carry out a test in the first place, countries that have performed more tests will tend to have more confirmed cases. In other words: there is a positive correlation between tests performed and cases confirmed. That doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that countries that have done more tests really have more cases, although in many cases they will.</p><p>However, the differences between countries can tell us important things. For instance, we can see that some countries have done more tests per confirmed case. The UK, for example, has done many more tests than other European countries with a similar number of confirmed cases.</p><p>The second chart plots the number of tests performed in each country. The most obvious point is that the data shows South Korea has done many more tests than other countries. That means we can expect that in South Korea the number of confirmed cases &#x2013; positive tests &#x2013; is closer to the real number of infected people than it is in other countries.</p><p>That makes it encouraging to see that the number of daily confirmed cases in South Korea has gone down. (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-cases-covid-19-who?time=1..59&amp;country=KOR">Here</a> you find our chart that shows the decline of confirmed new cases in South Korea.) South Korea was able to quickly manufacture and use a huge number of tests, showing that it is possible. Testing is crucial, so it is vital that other countries follow South Korea&#x2019;s lead.</p><p>A note about the chart: There are now too many countries in our dataset to show them all at once, so not all countries with available data are shown by default.

You&#x2019;ll see that some countries&#x2019; data is older than others, meaning that they can&#x2019;t be directly compared. For instance, the estimate for the province of Guangdong in China has not been updated since 24 February.</p><p>The first chart takes the size of the population into account. It plots the total number of tests per million people, against the total number of confirmed cases, also per million people. The higher the dot representing a country is, the more tests per million people it has carried out; the further right it is, the more tests per million people have come back positive.</p><p>We see that countries with higher rates of confirmed cases tend to be also countries where a larger share of the total population has been tested. Again, since you can only get a positive test if you carry out a test in the first place, countries that have performed more tests will tend to have more confirmed cases.</p><p>But again there are important differences between countries. Vietnam, for example, shows a much higher testing rate than Indonesia, although at this point in time (20 March 2020) both have a similar number of confirmed cases per million people.</p><p>From this perspective, it is clear that the US is lagging behind. The number of tests per million people in the US is almost 10 times lower than in Canada, and about 20 times lower than in South Korea. The US has had<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-have-been-tested-coronavirus/607597/"> big problems</a> rolling out their testing strategy, although they seem to be slowly catching up.</p><p>The second chart plots the number of tests per million people, country by country.

According to the WHO-China Joint Mission, the timeline for the development of the PCR tests was as follows: (i) On 29 December 2019 Chinese authorities identified a cluster of similar cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan in China; (ii) on 7 January, the virus found to cause COVID-19 was initially isolated from a clinical sample; (iii) on 16 January, the first PCR assays for COVID-19 were distributed to Hubei, China.

When diagnostic testing is negative, the possibility of a false negative result should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19.”</em> CDC (2020)<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Factsheet-for-Healthcare-Providers-2019-nCoV.pdf"> Fact sheet for healthcare providers</a>, CDC &#8211; 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel,&nbsp;March 15, 2020.</p></li><li id="note-13"><p>Note: The Wikipedia page on<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing"> COVID-19 Testing</a> also compiles available estimates. These often cover more countries, but they are sometimes inaccurate or out of date; the estimates are often incorrect, or trace back to unreliable sources.
