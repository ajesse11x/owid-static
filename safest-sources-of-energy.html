<section><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>At the start of the Industrial Revolution, it was discovered that the energy in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels">fossil fuels</a> can be unlocked to make work more productive. This finding transformed human development: for most of history, living conditions across the world were equally poor. This began to change, rapidly, once we learnt how to use coal, oil, and gas. In more recent years, we have also gained access to modern <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy">renewables</a> and nuclear power.</p><p>The increasing availability of cheap energy has been integral to the progress we&#x2019;ve seen over the past few centuries. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-access">Energy access</a> is one of the fundamental driving forces of development. The United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/">says</a> that &#x201C;energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today.&#x201D;</p><p>But energy production has downsides as well as benefits. There are three main categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Air pollution</strong>: An estimated <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution#air-pollution-is-one-of-the-world-s-leading-risk-factors-for-death">five million people</a> die prematurely every year as a result of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution">air pollution</a>; fossil fuels and biomass burning are responsible for most of those deaths.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Accidents</strong>: As well as deaths caused by the byproducts of energy production, people die in accidents in supply chains, whether in the mining of coal, uranium or rare metals; oil and gas extraction; the transport of raw materials and infrastructure; construction; or their deployment.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Greenhouse gas emissions</strong>: Perhaps the most widely discussed downside is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gases</a> emitted by energy production, which are a key driver of climate change.&#xA0;</li></ul><p>All energy sources have negative effects. But they differ enormously in the size of those effects. That difference can be easily summed up: by all metrics, fossil fuels are the dirtiest and most dangerous, while nuclear and modern renewable energy sources are vastly safer and cleaner. </p><p>From the perspectives of both human health and climate change, it matters less whether we use nuclear power or renewable energy, and more that we change to one or both of them rather than fossil fuels.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="nuclear-power-is-far-far-safer-than-fossil-fuels-contrary-to-public-belief"><a class="deep-link" href="#nuclear-power-is-far-far-safer-than-fossil-fuels-contrary-to-public-belief"></a>Nuclear power is far, far safer than fossil fuels, contrary to public belief</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>For most of the past 50 years, our energy systems have been dominated by fossil fuels, traditional biomass, hydropower and nuclear energy.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>In the future we expect renewable energy sources to contribute a rising share of total energy, but before we take a closer look at how renewables compare,&#xA0; let&#x2019;s first see how fossil fuels stack up against nuclear energy in terms of safety.</p><p>Anil Markandya and Paul Wilkinson (2007) published an analysis in the medical journal <em>The Lancet, </em>which compared the death rates from the major energy sources.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this study they considered deaths from accidents, such as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, occupational accidents in mining or power plant operations, and premature deaths from air pollution.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a>&#xA0;</p><p>This study was published in 2007, before the 2011 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster</a> in Japan. You might assume that the figures from this analysis therefore understate the death toll from nuclear energy, but in fact the opposite is true. Later in this article we look at a more recent study on the safety of low-carbon energy sources, published in 2016 which includes Fukushima impacts, and in fact reports a <em>lower</em> death rate than Markandya and Wilkinson (2007).<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> There were no direct deaths from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The official death toll was 573 people, all of which were premature deaths from evacuation and displacement of populations in the surrounding area.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 2018, the Japanese government <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45423575">reported</a> that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event.</p><p>To compare the safety of different energy sources, the researchers compared the number of deaths per unit of energy that is produced by them.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> In the visualization we see the safety comparison of fossil fuels, nuclear and biomass, measured as the number of deaths per terawatt-hour of energy production. One terawatt-hour of energy is about the same as the annual energy consumption of 27,000 citizens in the European Union.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>Nuclear energy is by far the safest energy source in this comparison &#x2013; it results in more than 442 times fewer deaths than the &#x2018;dirtiest&#x2019; forms of coal; 330 times fewer than coal; 250 times less than oil; and 38 times fewer than gas. To be clear: the figures in this analysis was based on energy production in Europe where anti-pollution regulation and technologies are already well ahead of many countries in the world;&#xA0; in this case the death rate from fossil fuels may even be understated.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s put this into the context of the 27,000 Europeans that one terawatt-hour would provide for. Here we are taking a very simplistic example, but imagine we have a village of 27,000 people.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> If they produced all of their energy from coal, we&#x2019;d expect 25 people to die prematurely <em>every year</em> as a result (most from the impacts of air pollution). If they generated their energy from oil we&#x2019;d expect 18 to die every year; and 3 to die if they relied on natural gas.&#xA0;</p><p>If they got their energy from nuclear power, in most years there would be no deaths. In fact, it would take at least 14 years before you would expect a single death. It may even be the case that this figure is an overestimate &#x2013; later in the article we look at a more recent analysis of nuclear safety which suggests this is closer to one death every 100 years.</p><p>Fossil fuels have therefore killed many more people than nuclear energy.&#xA0;</p><p>In many countries, however, public opinion on nuclear energy <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-opposition-to-nuclear-energy-production">is very negative</a> and, as a consequence, policy decisions have in some places turned harshly against it.&#xA0;</p><p>In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany announced plans to phase out nuclear power generation: over the period from 2011 to 2017 it shut down 10 of its 17 nuclear facilities, and plans to close the remaining reactors in 2022.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>These policy decisions can cost lives. In a study published in the journal <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>, Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen (2013) reversed the conventional question of &#x2018;how many people have died from nuclear power?&#x2019; into &#x2018;how many lives has nuclear power <em>saved</em>?&#x2019;.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a> They analysed how many additional people would have died over the period from 1971 to 2009 if nuclear energy had been replaced by fossil fuels. The human cost would have depended on the mix of fossil fuels used to replace nuclear &#x2013; more would have died if more coal was used than oil or gas &#x2013; but they estimate an average figure of two million lives saved.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>Replacing nuclear energy with fossil fuels kills people. This is likely to be the case in the recent example of Germany. Most of Germany&#x2019;s energy deficit from scrapping nuclear was filled by increased coal production &#x2013; the most polluting source with the largest health impacts. Analysis by Stephen Jarvis, Olivier Deschenes, and Akshaya Jha (2020) estimates that Germany&#x2019;s nuclear phase-out has come at the cost of more than 1,100 additional deaths each year as a result of air pollution.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> Its plans to make its energy systems safer have done exactly the opposite.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh" class="grapherPreview">

<p>The analysis of Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) and Sovacool et al. (2016) report different death rates for biomass and nuclear. Why do these estimates vary? <br><br><strong>Biomass: </strong>The difference between the biomass death rate figures is simple to explain: Markandya &amp; Wilkinson include the health impacts of air pollution. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution">Indoor air pollution</a>, which results from the burning of solid fuels (including wood, dung and other biomass sources) for cooking and heating in households <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution#indoor-air-pollution-is-one-of-the-leading-risk-factors-for-premature-death">kills 1.6 million people</a> every year, mainly in lower-income countries. Markandya &amp; Wilkinson (2007) focus their analysis in Europe where biomass energy is produced in state-of-the-art (in the year 2007, at least) facilities that maintain EU environmental standards. These health impacts are much lower than for indoor air pollution typical of lower-income countries, but can still be a significant contributor to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution">outdoor air pollution</a>. The inclusion of air pollution deaths is why their estimated death rates are much higher.</p>



<p>In contrast, Sovacool et al. (2016) do not include air pollution estimates, and instead focus on deaths from accidents at biomass production facilities (such as explosions or fires) and their supply chains. As a result, total death rate figures are much lower.</p>



<p><strong>Nuclear: </strong>there are two key points to differentiate in the estimates of nuclear energy safety. The first is the period which the studies cover. Analysis by Markandya &amp; Wilkinson (2007) predates the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and therefore does not include this accident in its estimates. This fact, however, does not fully explain why the two studies differ: we might assume the inclusion of the Fukushima disaster would increase death rates but in fact the estimates of Sovacool et al. (2016) are <em>lower</em>.&#xA0;</p>



<p>The largest differentiator here is the period which the Sovacool et al. (2016) estimates cover. They report normalized death rates over the limited period from 1990 to 2013. This means the 1986 Chernobyl accident was not included. Sovacool et al. (2016) only include deaths from the Fukushima accident, with 573 attributed deaths. It is useful to note here that not all deaths were a direct result of the accident: for Fukushima, there were no direct deaths from the disaster; one confirmed death from radiation exposure; and the rest noted as premature deaths from evacuation and displacement of populations in the surrounding area.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>



<p>The deaths which occurred as a result of the nuclear disaster were the result of the <em>response</em> to the event, rather than the event itself.</p>



<p>Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) include estimated death tolls from distinct accidents (not including Fukushima) but also provide an estimate of deaths from occupational effects. They note that deaths: <br>&#x201C;<em>can arise from occupational effects (especially from mining), routine radiation during generation, decommissioning, reprocessing, low-level waste disposal, high-level waste disposal, and accidents. The data [&#x2026;] show occupational deaths of around 0&#xB7;019 per TWh, </em><strong><em>largely at the mining, milling, and generation stages</em></strong><em>. These numbers are small in the context of normal operations. For example, a normal reactor of the kind in operation in France would produce 5&#xB7;7 TWh a year. Hence, more than 10 years of operations would be needed before a single occupational death could be attributed to the plant. Likewise, numbers of deaths through cancer, severe hereditary effects, and non-fatal cancers caused by normal operations are extremely small.&#x201D;</em></p>



<p>The estimates of Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) are therefore higher than Sovacool et al. (2016) because they include the Chernobyl disaster, and assume additional occupational deaths at various stages of the nuclear supply chain. This methodology adopts the &#x2018;linear non-threshold&#x2019; (LNT) method, which assumes there is no minimum &#x2018;safe&#x2019; threshold of radiation exposure, and that cancer risk increases linearly from zero. Since the study&#x2019;s publication, the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has made clear that the LNT method represents a highly cautious approach, and likely overstates the number of potential cancer cases and deaths which result from low-level radiation exposure.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>



<p>These estimates are therefore likely to be highly conservative. The LNT method, is however, still typically adopted in the development of radiation protection.</p>



<p>If we look at the case of the 2011 Fukushima disaster: the World Health Organization (WHO) Report published five years on, suggests very low risk of increased cancer deaths in Japan.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a> In a review of the response and long-term health impacts of Fukushima, published by Michael Reich and Aya Goto in <em>The Lancet</em>, the authors note that: &#x201C;no one has died from radiation exposure, and the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation report in 2013 stated that substantial changes in future cancer statistics attributed to radiation exposure are not expected to be observed&#x201D;.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a> These findings highlight the shift of consensus away from the historical linear non-threshold method, where it was assumed that even very low levels of exposure increased cancer risk.</p>

Figures for oil have therefore been taken from Turconi et al. (2013). It reports emissions in kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per megawatt-hour. Emissions factors for all other technologies are consistent with results from the IPCC. The range it gives for oil is 530–900: I have here taken the midpoint estimate (715 kgCO<sub>2</sub>eq/MWh, which is also 715 gCO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh). </p>

This means it does not take into account the inefficiencies in the conversion of fossil fuel energy inputs to final energy consumption. Since we are concerned here with the health impacts and greenhouse gas emissions generated by energy production (i.e. energy inputs) this is a more appropriate comparison than final energy demand – final energy demand would underestimate the air pollution and GHGs generated from fossil fuels. Energy comparisons by primary energy consumption and &#8216;corrections&#8217; which are a better approximation of final energy demand can be explored <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy#energy-consumption-by-source">here</a>.</p></li><li id="note-19"><p>Burgherr, P., &amp; Hirschberg, S.
