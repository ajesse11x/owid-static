All data from 1965 onwards, with the exception of traditional biomass is sourced from BP Statistical Review. Smil's estimates of traditional biomass are only available until 2015. For the years 2016 onwards, we have assumed a similar level of traditional biomass consumption. This is approximately in line with recent trends in traditional biomass from Smil's data.\n\nOur World in Data has normalised all BP fossil fuels data to terawatt-hours (TWh) using a conversion factor of 11.63 to convert from million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) to TWh.\n\nData represents primary energy (rather than final energy) consumption. 'Other renewables' represents all renewable sources minus solar, wind, and hydropower (e.g. geothermal, wave and tidal, and modern biofuels).\n\n\n"}}},"entityKey":{"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"}}}
