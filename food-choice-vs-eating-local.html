<section><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>People across the world are becoming increasingly concerned about climate change: 8-in-10 people see climate change as a major threat to their country.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>As I have shown <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-ghg-emissions"><strong>before</strong></a>, food production is responsible for one-quarter of the world&#x2019;s greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>There is rightly a growing awareness that our diet and food choices have a significant impact on our carbon &#x2018;footprint&#x2019;. What can you do to really reduce the carbon footprint of your breakfast, lunches, and dinner?<br><br>&#x2018;Eating local&#x2019; is a recommendation you hear often &#x2013; even from prominent sources, <a href="https://twitter.com/UN/status/1188622911080415235?s=20">including the United Nations</a>. While it might make sense intuitively &#x2013;&#xA0;after all, transport does lead to emissions &#x2013; it is one of the most misguided pieces of advice. </p><p>Eating locally would only have a significant impact if transport was responsible for a large share of food&#x2019;s final carbon footprint. For most foods, this is <em>not</em> the case.</p><p>GHG emissions from transportation make up a very small amount of the emissions from food and what you eat is <em>far more</em> important than where your food traveled from.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="where-do-the-emissions-from-our-food-come-from"><a class="deep-link" href="#where-do-the-emissions-from-our-food-come-from"></a>Where do the emissions from our food come from?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>In the visualization we see GHG emissions from 29 different food products&#xA0;&#x2013; from beef at the top to nuts at the bottom.</p><p>For each product you can see from which stage in the supply chain its emissions originate. This extends from land use changes on the left, through to transport and packaging on the right.<br>This is data from the largest meta-analysis of global food systems to date, published in <em>Science </em>by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek (2018).<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this study, the authors looked at data across more than 38,000 commercial farms in 119 countries.</p><p>In this comparison we look at the total GHG emissions per kilogram of food product. CO<sub>2</sub> is the most important GHG, but not the only one &#x2013; agriculture is a large source of the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. To capture all GHG emissions from food production researchers therefore express them in kilograms of &#x2018;carbon dioxide equivalents&#x2019;. This metric takes account not just CO<sub>2</sub> but all greenhouse gases.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>The most important insight from this study: there are massive differences in the GHG emissions of different foods: producing a kilogram of beef emits 60 kilograms of greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents). While peas emits just 1 kilogram per kg.</p><p>Overall, animal-based foods tend to have a higher footprint than plant-based. Lamb and cheese both emit more than 20 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents per kilogram. Poultry and pork have lower footprints but are still higher than most plant-based foods, at 6 and 7 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents, respectively.</p><p>For most foods &#x2013; and particularly the largest emitters &#x2013; most GHG emissions result from land use change (shown in green), and from processes at the farm stage (brown). Farm-stage emissions include processes such as the application of fertilizers &#x2013; both organic (&#x201C;manure management&#x201D;) and synthetic; and enteric fermentation (the production of methane in the stomachs of cattle). Combined, land use and farm-stage emissions account for more than 80% of the footprint for most foods.</p><p>Transport is a small contributor to emissions. For most food products, it accounts for less than 10%, and it&#x2019;s much smaller for the largest GHG emitters. In beef from beef herds, it&#x2019;s 0.5%.</p><p>Not just transport, but all processes in the supply chain after the food left the farm &#x2013; processing, transport, retail and packaging &#x2013; mostly account for a small share of emissions.<br>This data shows that this is the case when we look at <em>individual</em> food products. But studies also shows that this holds true for actual <em>diets</em>; <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#the-carbon-footprint-of-eu-diets-where-do-emissions-come-from">here</a></strong> we show the results of a study which looked at the footprint of diets across the EU. Food transport was responsible for only 6% of emissions, whilst dairy, meat and eggs accounted for 83%.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage.png" alt="Environmental impact of foods by life cycle stage" class="wp-image-29683" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage.png 6109w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage-400x359.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage-612x550.png 612w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage-150x135.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage-768x690.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage-1536x1380.png 1536w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Environmental-impact-of-foods-by-life-cycle-stage-2048x1840.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 6109px) 100vw, 6109px"></a></figure></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="eating-local-only-slightly-reduces-your-emissions"><a class="deep-link" href="#eating-local-only-slightly-reduces-your-emissions"></a>Eating local only slightly reduces your emissions</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Eating local beef or lamb has many times the carbon footprint of most other foods.

<p>You might think this figure is strongly dependent on where in the world you live, and how far your beef will have to travel. If you live somewhere very remote you&#x2019;d assume this must be much, much larger than if your beef is produced by your local farmer. But the key point here is that the difference in transport figures is very small relative to the total footprint of beef.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s take the example of beef from a beef herd &#x2013; the average footprint is approximately 60 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram of beef. Let&#x2019;s compare the transport footprint of buying from your local farmer (who turns out to be your neighbor), versus someone in the UK buying beef from Central America (approximately 9000 kilometers away).<br><br>Transporting food by boat emits 23 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram of product per kilometer. To transport the 9000 kilometers from Central America to the UK therefore emits 0.27 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq [9000km * 23g per tonne-kilometer / 1000 / 1000 = 0.27 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kg]. This is equivalent to 0.45% of the total footprint of the 60 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram of beef.&#xA0;</p>



<p>If you buy from your local farmer &#x2013; let&#x2019;s assume you walk there, and have zero transport emissions &#x2013; your beef footprint is 59.73 kilograms CO<sub>2</sub>eq per kilogram [we calculate this as 60kg &#x2013; 0.27kg]. It makes almost no difference.</p>



<p>Especially for foods with a large footprint, transport as a share of the food&#x2019;s total emissions is fairly insensitive to the distance travelled. </p>

</div></div></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>In a study published in <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology, </em>Christopher Weber and Scott Matthews (2008) investigated the relative climate impact of food miles and food choices in households in the US.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> Their analysis showed that substituting less than one day per week&#x2019;s worth of calories from beef and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a plant-based alternative reduces GHG emissions more than buying <em>all</em> your food from local sources.</p><p>By analysing consumer expenditure data, the researchers estimated that the average American household&#x2019;s food emissions were around 8 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per year. Food transport accounted for only 5% of this (0.4 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq).<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> This means that if we were to take the case where we assume a household sources <em>all</em> of their food locally, the maximum reduction in their footprint would be 5%. This is an extreme example because in reality there would still be small transport emissions involved in transporting food from producers in your area.</p><p>They estimated that if the average household substituted their calories from red meat and dairy to chicken, fish or eggs just one day per week they would save 0.3tCO<sub>2</sub>eq. If they replaced it with plant-based alternatives they would save 0.46&#xA0; tCO<sub>2</sub>eq. In other words, going &#x2018;red meat and dairy-free&#x2019; (not totally meat-free) one day per week would achieve the same as having a diet with <em>zero</em> food miles.</p><p>There are also a number of cases where eating locally might in fact <em>increase</em> emissions. In most countries, many foods can only be grown and harvested at certain times of the year. But consumers want them year-round. This gives us three options: import goods from countries where they are in-season; use energy-intensive production methods (such as greenhouses) to produce them year-round; or use refrigeration and other preservation methods to store them for several months. There are many examples of studies which show that importing often has a lower footprint.</p><p>Hospido et al. (2009) estimate that importing Spanish lettuce to the UK during winter months results in three to eight times lower emissions than producing it locally.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> The same applies for other foods: tomatoes produced in greenhouses in Sweden used 10 times as much energy as importing tomatoes from Southern Europe where they were in-season.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="avoid-the-small-share-of-foods-that-are-air-freighted"><a class="deep-link" href="#avoid-the-small-share-of-foods-that-are-air-freighted"></a>Avoid the small share of foods that are air-freighted</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The impact of transport is small for most products, but there is one exception: those which travel by air.</p><p>Many believe that air-freight is more common than it actually is. Very little food is air-freighted; <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-food-miles-by-method">it accounts for</a> only 0.16% of food miles.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> But for the few products which are transported by air, the emissions can be very high: it emits 50 times more CO<sub>2</sub>eq than boat per tonne kilometer.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>Many of the foods people assume to come by air are actually transported by boat &#x2013; avocados and almonds are prime examples. Shipping one kilogram of avocados from Mexico to the United Kingdom would generate 0.27kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq in transport emissions.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> This is only around 10% of avocados&#x2019; total footprint.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> Even when shipped at great distances, its emissions are much less than locally-produced animal products.</p><p>Which foods are air-freighted? How do we know which products to avoid?</p><p>They tend to be foods which are highly perishable. This means they need to be eaten soon after they&#x2019;ve been harvested. In this case, transport by boat is too slow, leaving air travel as the only feasible option.</p><p>Some fruit and vegetables tend to fall into this category. Asparagus, green beans and berries are common air-freighted goods.&#xA0;</p><p>It is often hard for consumers to identify foods that have travelled by air because they&#x2019;re rarely labeled as such. This makes them difficult to avoid. A general rule is to avoid foods that have a very short shelf-life <em>and</em> have traveled a long way (many labels have the country of &#x2018;origin&#x2019; which helps with this). This is especially true for foods where there is a strong emphasis on &#x2018;freshness&#x2019;: for these products, transport speed is a priority.</p><p>So, if you want to reduce the carbon footprint of your diet, avoid air-freighted foods where you can. But beyond this, you can have a larger difference by focusing on what you eat, rather than &#x2018;eating local&#x2019;. Eating less meat and dairy, or switching from ruminant meat to chicken, pork, or plant-based alternatives will reduce your footprint by much more.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>
