17 per cent of the worldwide child population. According to the publicly available data discussed in more detail below, Sub-Saharan Africa is the region where child labour is most prevalent. While absolute numbers are still high, particularly in&#xA0;those&#xA0;countries with the lowest standards of living, from a historical viewpoint&#xA0;there are concrete examples of countries that managed to virtually eliminate widespread child labour in the course of a century.&#xA0;The United Kingdom is a case in point. In terms of recent developments,&#xA0;global&#xA0;trends show a significant reduction in child labour over the last couple of decades.&#xA0;However, there is&#xA0;wide dispersion in the progress that different countries have achieved.<br></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="block-wrapper" data-reactroot><div data-variation="full-width" class="wp-block-owid-additional-information"><h3 id="all-our-charts-on-child-labor"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="angle-right" class="svg-inline--fa fa-angle-right fa-w-8 " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M224.3 273l-136 136c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.6-22.6c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l96.4-96.4-96.4-96.4c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L54.3 103c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l136 136c9.5 9.4 9.5 24.6.1 34z"/></svg>All our charts on Child Labor</h3><div style="height:0;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" class="rah-static rah-static--height-zero"><div style="transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;-webkit-transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;opacity:0"><div class="content">

The available historical evidence seems consistent with the fact that industrialisation in western countries initially increased the demand for child labour, but then eventually contributed towards its elimination (see Cunningham, H., &amp; Viazzo, P. P. (1996)<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the references therein). These three visualizations show the share of children in employment for Italy, the UK and the United States at the turn of the 20th century. For the US chart you can add data on rural versus urban child labour trends: for both boys and girls, the incidence of child labour was higher in rural populations.</p><p>As we see, the incidence of child labour in Italy appeared to be higher than that of the UK and US, with slower rates of decline. In the US, by 1930 the incidence of child labour is estimated to be below 5%; this level was not reached in Italy until around 30 years later, in 1960.</p><p>Whilst consistent survey data on child labour in the UK is limited beyond 1911, some estimates of 20th century labour have emerged. These statistics show the significant impact of the First and Second World Wars on childhood employment. Following a reported spike in employment during the First World War (1914-1918), rates of childhood labour appeared to fall to approximately 6-7 per cent of children aged 12-14 in England and Wales.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> This would make the UK&#x2019;s rate of reduction in child labour slightly faster than that of the United States. However, with the onset of the Second World War in 1939, the incidence of child employment appeared to show another spike- by 1944, this had increased again to 15.3 per cent of 12-14 year olds.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-side-by-side"><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-italy" class="grapherPreview">

This report presents global estimates and trends for the period 2000-2012. The first visualization, based on this source, presents the recent changes in the world-wide share of children (ages 5-17) in employment. (You can view the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-incidence-of-child-labour-2" target="_blank">interactive version of the same chart (with access to the data) here</a>.) </p><p>As we discuss <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/#definitions-and-measurement">below</a>, there is lack of consensus regarding the appropriate ages for measuring child labor, particularly for the purpose of cross-country comparisons and global aggregates. The age bracket ranging from 5 to 17 years of age is common in many UN reports, but there is evidently a need to differentiate work at different ages, since children in their teenage years are less vulnerable to workplace abuse. Other common age brackets are 5-11 and 5-14 years of age.</p><p>The second visualization presents global trends, using estimates in two age brackets: 5-14 and 15-17 years of age. The source of the data is the same as above (ILO&#x2019;s report Marking Progress Against Child Labour 2013). Unfortunately these global estimates are not broken down by gender, and are not available for other age brackets. However, the pattern is consistent with the remark made above: child labour has been going down in recent years.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_child-labor-global-post-2000-750x525.png" alt="child-labor-global-post-2000" class="wp-image-7277" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_child-labor-global-post-2000-750x525.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_child-labor-global-post-2000-150x105.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_child-labor-global-post-2000-400x280.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_child-labor-global-post-2000-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_child-labor-global-post-2000.png"></figure></div><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-incidence-of-child-labour-by-age-groups" class="grapherPreview">

While these estimates are informative about child labour, they cannot be linked directly to those of children in employment published by the ILO IPEC for the period 2000-2012 due to issues of comparability; specifically, the IPEC and EPEAP estimates discussed above rely on different survey instruments covering a different set of countries, and break up the relevant population in different age brackets.</p><p>Many studies rely on the LABORSTA data to shed light on the extent of child labour in the 20th century. However, this source is generally believed to understate the extent of child labour, since data is not collected for work inside the household (not even market work).

Since time is a scarce resource, the extent to which children&#x2019;s employment is linked to school attendance depends on the type and number of hours worked.</p><p>The visualization shown here is taken from Schultz and Strauss (2008) and presents evidence of this link using data from UNICEF&#x2019;s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2000 and 2001). It plots school attendance rates for children 10&#x2013;14 against total hours worked in the last week (by type of work) with 95 percent confidence intervals (labeled CI and plotted in lighter shades).</p><p>The steepest part of the pictured curves are in the range 20-45 hours, suggesting&#x2014;as one would naturally expect&#x2014;that it is most difficult for a child to attend school when approaching&#xA0;full-time work. This evidence also shows that there are no significant difference by domestic or marketed work.</p><p>This chart shows the relationship between school attendance and hours worked using micro data (i.e. the authors plot the relationship by pooling observations across individual households). A similar pattern can also be seen in the data if we look at aggregates: In countries where children tend to work longer hours, it is more common that working children remain out of school. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/working-children-out-of-school-ages-7-14-vs-hours-worked-by-children-ages-7-14">This interactive chart shows this</a> by plotting country-level average hours worked by children against share of working children who are out of school.</p><p>The above relationship between work and schooling is informative about the impact of children&#x2019;s work on schooling, but is not sufficient to establish causality; there are many potential economic and cultural factors that simultaneously influence both schooling and work decisions; and in any case, the direction of the relationships is not obvious&#x2014;do children work because they are not attending school, or do they fail to attend school <em>because</em> they are working?</p><p>A number of academic studies have tried to establish causality by attempting to find a factor (an &#x2018;instrumental variable&#x2019;) that only affects whether a child works without affecting how the family values other uses of the child&#x2019;s time (e.g. Rosati, F., Rossi, M.

This visualization depicts the cross-country incidence of child labour (share of children ages 7-14 involved in economic activity) against GDP per capita (PPP adjusted GDP per capita in international dollars). To provide some context regarding the absolute number of children, each country&#x2019;s observation is pictured as a circle where the size of the circle represents population aged 5-14.</p><p>This evidence cannot be interpreted causally; as before, countries differ in many aspects that may be associated with child labour choices and income. But there are a number of reasons why, conceptually, child labour might be indeed <em>caused</em> by poor living conditions. For example, children might only work if the parents are unable to meet subsistence conditions; or it could be the case that parents allocate more of the children&#x2019;s time to schooling as they afford the necessary inputs for schooling (text-books, uniforms, etc).</p><p>Partly following this logic, several countries have implemented cash transfer programmes in an attempt to discourage child labour and increase schooling. The idea behind these programmes is that the cash transfers are conditioned on a number of&#xA0;desirable actions, including sending children to school; and in doing so,&#xA0;they lower the relative costs of schooling and raise family income. &#xA0;Schultz (2004)<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> evaluates one such program in Mexico&#xA0;(the so-called &#x2018;Progresa&#x2019; program) and &#xA0;finds a significant reduction in wage and market work associated with eligibility for Progresa. Similar findings have been found in other countries as well. The literature often refers to these programmes as the prime example of &#x201C;collaborative measures&#x201D; against child labour: non-coercive interventions that alter the economic environment of decision makers in order to make them more willing to let children stay out of work.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview">

The authors highlight difficulties arising from coverage (i.e. capturing the most vulnerable children through random sampling) and accuracy (i.e. misreported hours worked and sensitivity to the recall period used).</p><p>Cunningham and Viazzo (1996) and Humphries (2010)<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> note similar challenges in the use of national census and household survey data for accurate coverage of the incidence of child labour. There remains a generally accepted consensus that census data is likely to underestimate the scale of child labour for several reasons. This is particuarly important in case of later censuses, where national regulation required children to be in education; in this case, child labour was likely to be underreported, for fear of prosecution. These estimates therefore often underrepresent the numerous children, particularly girls, who worked unpaid at home. Since census results typically capture data from households, this often limits coverage to children who live within a family household. This can exclude children either orphaned, or living on the streets- in many cases, we might expect the incidence of child labour to be more prevalent in these demographics.</p><p>Specifically regarding the information published by the World Bank in their World Development Indicators, it is important to highlight that, while definitions are standardized (children in employment are always defined as those children aged 7-14 involved in economic activity for at least one hour in the reference week of the corresponding survey), the data-collection instruments are not standardized across the different sub-sources feeding the consolidated dataset. It is because of this that many policy reports (such as the much-referenced report <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf"> Marking Progress Against Child Labour (2013) </a>) &#x2018;homogenize&#x2019; the data before reporting estimates, by correcting for discrepancies in the underlying survey instruments. Those visualizations presented here that use the consolidated data published by the World Bank have not been corrected.</p><p>Issues of consistency across different survey instruments in the World Bank consolidated data can help us explain country-specific patterns that are otherwise difficult to interpret. Consider the case of India. As can be appreciated in this visualization, the incidence of child labour in India seems to jump up in 2006, only to go back in 2010 to the levels that would have been predicted with the observations from 2000 and 2005. After checking the <a href="http://www.ucw-project.org/survey-catalogue.aspx"> survey catalogue</a>, it becomes clear that the estimates for 2006 come from the country&#x2019;s Demographic and Health Survey, while those for the other years come from consecutive rounds of the National Sample Survey. Cases such as this illustrate why current academic studies typically rely on data stemming from a single survey instrument, such as UNICEF&#x2019;s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys.<br></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-india" class="grapherPreview">

As we discuss <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/#child-labour-and-schooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">above</a>, Schultz and Strauss (2008) present estimates of &#x2018;children in economic activity&#x2019;, by type of activity (market work and domestic work) and by number of hours worked. To do this, the authors used mainly UNICEF&#x2019;s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) from 2000 and 2001. It would be extremely helpful for researchers and policymakers if such exercises were updated and published regularly in open-access data portals.</p><p>Regarding gaps in empirical research, it is important to highlight the lack of robust evidence speaking to the consequences of child labour on future outcomes &#x2013; such as the working children&#x2019;s subsequent health and earnings in adulthood. Schultz and Strauss (2008) provide a summary of available evidence on this research front. The body of literature is thin and the econometric results tend to be fragile because of difficulties to establish causality.</p><p>A related research question for which there is little robust empirical evidence is whether child labor is the result of &#x2018;agency problems&#x2019; &#x2013; namely, whether children work <em>because</em> parents fail to fully consider the tradeoffs and costs that work has on their children.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

Many studies rely on the LABORSTA/ILOSTAT data to shed light on the extent of child labour in the 20th century, before ILO started producing specialized child labour data. LABORSTA/ILOSTAT data&#xA0;is however problematic as a source to measure child labour, since data on work inside the household (even market work) are often not collected.
