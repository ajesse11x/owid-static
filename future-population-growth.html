		<h2 id="summary"><a class="deep-link" href="#summary"></a>Summary</h2>
		

<ul><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#global-population-growth">The UN projects that the global population increases from a population of 7.7 billion in 2019 to 11.2 billion by the end of the century. By that time, the UN projects, fast global population growth will come to an end.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#population-growth-by-world-region">Beneath the global level, there are of course, big differences between different world regions and countries. While in some regions the world population will likely grow rapidly for the coming decades other regions will continue to see declining population numbers.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#projections-of-the-drivers-of-population-growth">Global population growth is determined by the number of births and deaths. Improving health is increasing the size of the population as it is decreasing mortality. The countervailing trend are falling fertility rates &#x2013; the trend of couples having fewer children is what brought rapid population growth to an end in many countries already, and what will bring an end to rapid population growth globally.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#the-population-growth-rate">The global population growth rate has already slowed down considerably: It reached its peak at over 2% in the late 1960s and has been falling since.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#how-accurate-have-past-population-projections-been">The UN projections for the global population growth rates, which have been produced since the 1950s, have a good track record in projecting the size of the global population.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#progress-in-global-education-now-matters-for-the-size-of-the-global-population-in-the-21st-century">While the UN projections are most widely know there are other very carefully produced projections. The demographers of WC-IIASA model what will happen according to different scenarios and make clear that the population growth rate tomorrow depends on what we do today. Rapid progress in getting children and especially girls into schools will result in a much smaller global population.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#whether-the-world-population-will-reach-10-billion-will-likely-depend-on-africa">The biggest disagreement between different projections is concerning the future of Africa.

For many countries the <em><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#the-demographic-transition-why-is-rapid-population-increase-a-temporary-phenomenon">demographic transition</a></em> has already ended, and as the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#the-global-fertility-rate-has-halved-in-the-last-50-years">global fertility rate has now halved</a> we know that the world as a whole is approaching the end of rapid population growth.</p><p>This visualization presents this big overview of the global demographic transition &#x2013; with the very latest data from the UN Population Division just <a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/index.asp">published</a>.</p><p>As we explore at the beginning of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth">entry on population growth</a>, the global population grew only very slowly up to 1700 &#x2013; only 0.04% per year. In the many millennia up to that point in history <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past">very high mortality of children</a> counteracted high fertility. The world was in the first stage of the demographic transition.</p><p>Once <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-global-overview">health improved and mortality declined</a> things changed quickly. Particularly over the course of the 20th century: Over the last 100 years global population more than quadrupled.&#xA0;As we see in the chart, the rise of the global population got steeper and steeper and you have just lived through the steepest increase of that curve. This also means that your existence is a tiny part of the reason why that curve is so steep.</p><p>The 7-fold increase of the world population over the course of two centuries amplified humanity&#x2019;s impact on the natural environment. To provide space, food, and resources for a large world population in a way that is sustainable into the distant future is without question one of the large, serious challenges for our generation. We should not make the mistake of underestimating the task ahead of us. Yes, I expect new generations <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-14/want-to-help-fight-climate-change-have-more-children">to contribute</a>, but for now it is upon us to provide for them. Population growth is still fast: Every year 140 million are born and 58 million die&#xA0;&#x2013; the difference is the number of people that we add to the world population in a year: 82 million.</p><p>Where do we go from here?</p><p>In red you see the annual population growth rate (that is, the percentage change in population per year) of the global population. It peaked around half a century ago. Peak population growth was reached in 1968 with an annual growth of 2.1%.&#xA0;Since then the increase of the world population has slowed and today grows by just over 1% per year. This slowdown of population growth was not only predictable, but <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#how-accurate-have-past-population-projections-been">predicted</a>. Just as expected by demographers (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#the-demographic-transition-why-is-rapid-population-increase-a-temporary-phenomenon">here</a>), the world as a whole is experiencing the closing of a massive demographic transition.</p><p>This chart also shows how the United Nations envision the slow ending of the global demographic transition. As population growth continues to decline, the curve representing the world population is getting less and less steep. By the end of the century &#x2013; when global population growth will have fallen to 0.1% according to the UN&#x2019;s projection &#x2013; the world will be very close to the end of the demographic transition. It is hard to know the population dynamics beyond 2100; it will depend upon the fertility rate and as we discuss in our entry on fertility rates <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#fertility-is-first-falling-with-development-and-then-rising-with-development">here</a>&#xA0;fertility is first falling with development &#x2013; and then rising with development. The question will be whether it will rise above an average 2 children per woman.</p><p>The world enters the last phase of the demographic transition and this means we will not repeat the past. The global population has quadrupled over the course of the 20th century, but it will not double anymore over the course of this century.</p><p>The world population will reach a size, which compared to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#how-has-world-population-growth-changed-over-time">humanity&#x2019;s history</a>, will be extraordinary; if the UN projections are accurate (they <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth#how-accurate-have-past-population-projections-been">have</a> a good track record), the world population will have increased more than 10-fold over the span of 250 years.</p><p>We are on the way to a new balance. The big global demographic transition that the world entered more than two centuries ago is then coming to an end: This new equilibrium is different from the one in the past when it was the very high mortality that kept population growth in check. In the new balance it will be low fertility keeps population changes small.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/2019-Revision-&#x2013;-World-Population-Growth-1700-2100-772x550.png" alt="2019 revision &#x2013; world population growth 1700 2100" class="wp-image-23772" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/2019-Revision-&#x2013;-World-Population-Growth-1700-2100-772x550.png 772w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/2019-Revision-&#x2013;-World-Population-Growth-1700-2100-150x107.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/2019-Revision-&#x2013;-World-Population-Growth-1700-2100-400x285.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/2019-Revision-&#x2013;-World-Population-Growth-1700-2100-768x547.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/2019-Revision-&#x2013;-World-Population-Growth-1700-2100.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-un-population-projection-by-country-and-world-region-until-2100"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-un-population-projection-by-country-and-world-region-until-2100"></a>The UN population projection by country and world region until 2100</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The chart shows the change of the total population since 1950 and from 2015 it shows the UN population projection until the end of the century. </p><p>This interactive visualization you can change to any other country or world region.</p><p>By switching to the map view you can explore the projection of the distribution of the global population.</p><p>As we see here, there is a significant fall in the population growth rate, particularly in the second half of the 21st century.

How do we know? The moment in demographic history when the number of children in the world stops increasing is not far away. It is the moment that Hans Rosling famously called &#x2018;peak child&#x2019; and it is pre-emptive of the moment in history when the population stops increasing.</p><p>Since 1950 the total number of children younger than 15 years of age increased rapidly, from 0.87 billion children to 1.96 billion today.  The solid purple and red lines in the visualization indicate the total number of children in the world. As we can see, we are not far away from the largest cohort of children that there will likely ever be. The world is approaching what the late Hans Rosling called &#x201C;the age of peak child&#x201D;. </p><p>The gray lines show the total world population &#x2013; rising life expectancy and falling fertility rates mean that the world population of adults will increase while the number of children is stagnating. </p><p>This is an extraordinary moment in global history. In the past, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past">child mortality was extremely high</a>, and only two children per woman reached adulthood &#x2013; if more had survived the population size would have not been stable. This also means that the extended family with many children, that we often associate with the past, was only a reality for glimpse in time. Only the few generations during the population boom lived in families with many children &#x2013; before and after two children are the norm. The future will resemble our past, except that children are not dying, but are never born in the first place.</p><p>Between 1950 and today it was mostly a widening of the entire pyramid that was responsible for the increase of the world population. What is responsible for the increase of the world population from now on is not a widening of the the base, but a fill up of the population above the base. Not children will be added to the world population, but people in working age and old age. At a country level &#x201C;peak child&#x201D; is followed by a time in which the country benefits from a &#x201C;demographic dividend&#x201D;. The demographic structure of a country is reshaped so that the proportion of people in working age rises and that of the dependent young generation falls. The demographic dividend can result in a rise of productive contributions and a growing economy.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now there is reason to expect that the world as a whole benefits from a &#x201C;demographic dividend&#x201D;.</p><p>The big demographic transition that the world entered more than a century ago is coming to an end: Global population growth peaked half a century ago, the number of babies is reaching its peak, and the age profile of the women in the world is changing so that &#x2018;population momentum&#x2019; is slowly losing its momentum. This is not to say that feeding and supporting a still rising world population will be easy, but we are certainly on the way to a new balance where it&#x2019;s not high mortality keeping population growth in check, but low fertility rates.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-demand-for-education-world-population-and-projected-growth-to-2100-by-age-group?time=1950..2100" class="grapherPreview">

Now in 2019, there are 7.7 billion. By the end of the century the UN expects a global population of 11.2 billion. This visualization of the population pyramid makes it possible to understand this enormous global transformation.</p><p>Population pyramids visualize the demographic structure of a population. The width represents the size of the population of a given age; women on the right and men to the left. The bottom layer represents the number of newborns and above it you find the numbers of older cohorts. Represented in this way the population structure of societies with high mortality rates resembled a pyramid &#x2013; this is how this famous type of visualization got its name.</p><p>In the darkest blue you see the pyramid that represents the structure of the world population in 1950. Two factors are responsible for the pyramid shape in 1950: An increasing number of births broadened the base layer of the population pyramid and a continuously high risk of death throughout life is evident by the pyramid narrowing towards the top. There were many newborns relative to the number of people at older ages.</p><p>The narrowing of the pyramid just above the base is testimony to the fact that more than 1-in-5 children born in 1950 died before they reached the age of five.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>Through shades of blue and green the same visualization shows the population structure over the last decades up to 2018. You see that in each subsequent decade the population pyramid was fatter than before &#x2013; in each decade more people of all ages were added to the world population.</p><p>If you look at the green pyramid for 2018 you see that the narrowing above the base is much less strong than back in 1950; the child mortality rate fell from 1-in-5 in 1950 to fewer than 1-in-20 today.</p><p>In comparing 1950 and 2018 we see that the number of children born has increased &#x2013; 97 million in 1950 to 143 million today &#x2013; and that the mortality of children decreased at the same time. If you now compare the base of the pyramid in 2018 with the projection for 2100 you see that the coming decades will not resemble the past: According to the projections there will be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/peak-child">fewer children born</a>&#xA0;at the end of this century than today. The base of the future population structure is narrower.</p><p>We are at a turning point in global population history. Between 1950 and today, it was a widening of the entire pyramid &#x2013; an increase of the number of children &#x2013; that was responsible for the increase of the world population. From now on is not a widening of the base, but a &#x2018;fill up&#x2019; of the population above the base: the number of children will barely increase and then start to decline, but the number of people of working age and old age will increase very substantially. As global health is improving and mortality is falling, the people alive today are expected to live longer than any generation before us.</p><p>At a country level &#x201C;peak child&#x201D; is often followed by a time in which the country benefits from a &#x201C;demographic dividend&#x201D; when the proportion of the dependent young generation falls and the share of the population in working age increases.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>This is now happening at a global scale. For every child younger than 15 there were 1.8 people in working-age (15 to 64) in 1950; today there are 2.5; and by the end of the century there will be 3.4.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Richer countries have benefited from this transition in the last decades and are now facing the demographic problem of an increasingly larger share of retired people that are not contributing to the labor market. In the coming decades it will be the poorer countries that can benefit from this demographic dividend.</p><p>The change from 1950 to today and the projections to 2100 show a world population that is becoming healthier. When the top of the pyramid becomes wider and looks less like a pyramid and instead becomes more box-shaped, the population lives through younger ages with very low risk of death and dies at an old age. The demographic structure of a healthy population at the final stage of the demographic transition is the box shape that we see for the entire world for 2100.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>The Demography of the World Population from 1950 to 2100<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-793x550.jpg" alt="Population pyramid 1950 to 2100" class="wp-image-23114" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-793x550.jpg 793w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-150x104.jpg 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-400x278.jpg 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-768x533.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/04/Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div></section>

But how is this growth distributed across the world? How does the world look in 2100 compared to today?</p><p>In this chart we see the global population split by region. This shows historical data, but also projections to 2100 based on the UN&#x2019;s medium growth scenario.</p><p>The striking change between now and 2100 is the expected growth in the African population. Today, its population is around 1.3 billion; by 2100 it&#x2019;s projected to more than triple to 4.3 billion.</p><p>Over the past 50 years Asia experienced rapid population growth. Today its population stands at around 4.6 billion. By 2050 it&#x2019;s expected to rise to 5.3 billion, but then fall in the latter half of the century. You can read more about the driving force behind these demographic changes <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#the-demographic-transition-why-is-rapid-population-increase-a-temporary-phenomenon">here</a></strong>. By 2100 Asia&#x2019;s population is projected to fall almost back to levels we see today.</p><p>You can use the &#x2018;relative&#x2019; toggle in the chart to see each region&#x2019;s share of the world population. Here we see that today Africa has just over 17% of the global population; by 2100 this is projected to rise to 40%. Asia will see a significant fall from almost 60% today to just over 40% in 2100.</p><p>By the end of the century, more than 8 out of every 10 people in the world will live in Asia or Africa.</p><p>North, Central and South America, and Oceania, are projected to also see a rise in population this century &#x2013; but this growth will be much more modest relative to growth in Africa. Europe is the only region where population is expected to fall &#x2013; today its population stands at around 747 million; by 2100 this is projected to fall to 630 million.</p><p>These changes will bring new opportunities and challenges. Extreme poverty, for example, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#is-the-world-on-track-to-end-extreme-poverty-by-2030">is expected to</a> become increasingly concentrated in Africa in the decades which follow. This will represent a major shift from the century before.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/historical-and-projected-population-by-region" class="grapherPreview">

Each release of these statistics is called a <em>revision</em>, and allocated the year of publication (e.g. 1990 Revision). The latest revision in 2017 was the UN&#x2019;s 25th publication.</p><p>In this chart we see comparison of various UN Revisions of world population, dating back to the 1968 publication. Shown as the solid line is the latest 2017 Revision, which we can consider to be the &#x2018;actual&#x2019; population size up to 2015.</p><p>Here we see that although each revision provided different projections, most turned out to be relatively close. For example, it&#x2019;s estimated that the global population in 1990 was 5.34 billion. Most projections were close to this value: even the earliest revision in 1968 projected a 1990 population of 5.44 billion.</p><p>In 2010, it&#x2019;s estimated the global population was seven billion; previous projections were in the range of 6.8 to 7.2 billion. In 2015, the global population was estimated to be 7.4 billion; the 1990 Revision overestimated with a projection of 7.7 billion whilst the 1998 Revision underestimated at 7.2 billion.</p><p>Similar results are true for UN projections even earlier than the 1970s. Kielman (2001) looked at how UN projections from 1950 to 1995 matched with the actual population figures.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p> Projections as far back as 1950 were remarkably close to the later estimates.</p><p>There are of course many factors which will influence the rate of population growth in the coming decades. Projections become increasingly uncertain (and tend to converge most) the further into the future they go. This means we&#x2019;d expect higher uncertainty in projections for 2100 than those for 2050.</p><p>Future projections will continue to be refined over time. Nonetheless, the surprising accuracy of historical projections should give us confidence that although imperfect, UN population projections have usually turned out to be very close to the truth.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-projections-by-un-prospects-revision" class="grapherPreview">

They then combine the country specific expertise of these researchers with similar quantitative information that the UN and others rely on as well.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> The work by WC-IIASA is highly respected among demographers and key publications by the researchers are regularly published in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>The WC-IIASA projections are taking into account the demographic structure of the educational attainment of the population. While other projections are only structuring the demographic data by sex and age-group, the WC-IIASA data is additionally breaking down the population data by the level of highest educational attainment of different parts of the population. This information on educational attainment is then used for both the output of the model &#x2013; so that population projections for each country of the world by highest educational attainment are available (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/projections-of-future-education/">also on Our World in Data</a>). And crucially the information on education is also used as an an input into the model, so that the impact of different future scenarios for education on both mortality and fertility can be modeled explicitly.</p><p>The level of highest educational attainment is categorized in a system that aims to capture the structure of populations across the different country-specific educational systems. These categorizations are based on the the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), which was designed by the UNESCO to make education statistics comparable across countries. WC-IIASA breaks down the educational structure into the following 6 categories and the table summarizes how the six categories are defined, how they correspond to ISCED 1997, and the main allocation rules the researchers used.</p><p>For children younger than 15 years old no educational attainment information is available as most of them are still in the process of education.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Categories of educational attainment used by IIASA-WC and how they correspond to the ISCED levels<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Edu-Attainment-IIASA-WC-607x550.png" alt="Edu attainment iiasa wc" class="wp-image-13897" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Edu-Attainment-IIASA-WC-607x550.png 607w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Edu-Attainment-IIASA-WC-150x136.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Edu-Attainment-IIASA-WC-400x363.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Edu-Attainment-IIASA-WC-768x696.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Edu-Attainment-IIASA-WC.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-four-scenarios-for-global-education-by-wc-iiasa"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-four-scenarios-for-global-education-by-wc-iiasa"></a>The four scenarios for global education by WC-IIASA</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Projections of the global population take into account how the fertility rate will change in each country over the coming decades. The WC-IIASA projections are particularly helpful for the discussion here as they are the only projections that break down the demographic projections by the educational level of the populations and then model how different educational scenarios would affect the fertility rate in countries across the world. This then allows comparisons of how education matters for the size and distribution of the future population of the planet.</p><p>The researchers developed 4 different basic scenarios and a larger number of combinations based on these scenarios:</p><p><strong>Constant Enrollment Numbers (CEN):</strong> This is the researcher&#x2019;s most pessimistic scenario. Here it is assumed that no more schools are being opened in any place in the world so that the absolute number of people reaching a particular educational level is frozen at the current number. This means that enrollment rates are declining when the population size increases.<br>
In practice the WC-IIASA researchers almost always consider CER as the most pessimistic scenario and only rarely discuss CEN.</p><p><strong>Constant Enrollment Rates (CER)</strong>: This is another pessimistic scenario. While in the CEN scenario the absolute <em>number</em>&#xA0;of enrolled students stagnates, the assumption in the CER scenario is that the <em>rate </em>of enrollment stagnates. In this scenario the most recently observed rates of educational enrollment are frozen at their current rate and no further improvement in enrollment is assumed.<br>
This will still result in further improvements of adult education because in many countries the younger cohorts are better educated than the older ones.

Under this scenario the WC-IIASA researchers project a global fertility rate just below 2 and a fertility rate for Africa just above 2. The pessimistic scenario of WC-IIASA is similar to the UN Medium projection, and all of the more optimistic WC-IIASA scenarios imply lower fertility rates.

What happens in Africa now and in the coming decades will determine what size and structure the global population will have at the end of the century.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><p>There is considerable disagreement between UN and WC-IIASA projections. Even the medium projections vary significantly between the two institutions: The UN projects a population of 4.5 billion while WC-IIASA projects a population of only 2.6 billion. This difference of 2 billion is just as large as the difference between the projection for the global population by the UN (11.2 billion in 2100) and WC-IIASA (8.9 billion in 2100). Whether the world population increases to more than 10 billion will be decided by the speed with which Africa develops &#x2013; especially how quickly women get access to better education, women&#x2019;s opportunities within the job market, and how rapidly the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality">improvements in child health</a> continue.</p><p>This also matters significantly for some particular countries: For example, in Nigeria (currently a population of 190 million) the UN <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/un-population-projection-medium-variant?tab=chart&amp;country=NGA">projects</a> a population of 794 million at the end of the century. WC-IIASA, however, projects the population to be more than 25 percent smaller at 576 million.</p><p>Currently the total fertility rate in Africa still stands at 4.4 children per woman, according to the UN. It took 42 years (from 1972 to 2014) for global fertility to fall from 4.5 to 2.5 children. The UN projects that for Africa it will take longer than that &#x2013; 56 years (from 2016 to 2072) &#x2013; while the WC-IIASA researchers project a faster decline.</p><p>There are reasons to be optimistic that Africa could develop faster than the projections of the UN assume:</p><p>We <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#increasing-well-being-and-status-of-children">know</a> that falling mortality is associated with a decline of fertility. And health in Africa is improving rapidly:<br>&#x2013; The child mortality rate in Africa has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-around-the-world">halved over the last two decades</a>.<br>&#x2013; HIV/AIDS is still a serious threat, but the epidemic is past its peak and the incidence rate in Sub-Saharan Africa has fallen <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/incidence-of-hiv-the-share-of-new-infections-among-the-previously-uninfected-population-ages-15-49?tab=chart&amp;country=Sub-Saharan%20Africa">by two thirds in the last 2 decades</a>.<br>&#x2013; Malaria too is in steep decline and the annual number of deaths has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-malaria-deaths-by-world-region">almost halved in just the last 15 years</a>.</p><p>&#x2013; Crucially, education has also changed substantially across Africa: The young generation is <a href="https://africaindata.org/#/10">much better educated than older generations</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/Share-primary-school-age-out-of-school?country=Sub-Saharan%20Africa+Middle%20East%20%26%20North%20Africa">the share of children out of school is falling rapidly</a>.<br>&#x2013; After decades of stagnation in many parts of Africa, economies across the continent are now growing and the share of the population in extreme poverty <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-in-extreme-poverty-by-world-region">is now falling</a>.</p><p>If you want to see more on how Africa is changing have a look at our slide show at <a href="https://africaindata.org/#/title-slide">AfricaInData.org</a>.</p><p>Still, living conditions in most parts of the African continent are very poor and it would be too early to say that the changes that we are seeing now are foreshadowing the improvements which will lower fertility rates more rapidly. This will be determined only in the coming years, and the quantity and quality of education will be crucial as the visualization below shows. How quickly global population growth will slow will be decided by the chance of girls to go to school and the chances they have in life afterwards.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/projections-of-the-population-younger-than-15-in-africa-by-education-scenario" class="grapherPreview">

In Science, 333 (2011), pp. 587–592 <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/587.full">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/587.full</a> The changes of the demographic structure of the world population stem from two forces predominantly: Firstly the different assumptions about the trajectories in female educational attainment, and secondly, different levels of education-specific fertility. In the analysis below, the education-specific fertility levels will differ across scenarios, but to gauge the importance of different possible trajectories I am here interested in the effect of the different assumptions about the trajectories of educational attainment. This lets us see the impact of different futures with respect to educational attainment alone.</p></li><li id="note-17"><p>As can be seen from the chart, improvements in the education of women will eventually have a large impact on the size of the global population. But for two reasons the impact of educational improvements in the short-run will take some time to become apparent on a global scale: The first reason for this lag is that a girl who receives additional education now will only be in her childbearing years in 15 to 20 years. The second reason is that population momentum, driven by a high proportion of women in their child bearing years, can mean that the population keeps on growing even if the fertility rate falls to the replacement level.</p></li><li id="note-18"><p>This visualization is adapted from&nbsp;Wolfgang Lutz, William P.

In these different scenarios <em>education-specific fertility levels</em> now also differ across scenarios, which means that the differences across scenarios are even larger than in the projections above where education-specific fertility levels were the same across the different scenarios.</p></li><li id="note-20"><p>It would be interesting to see the projected number of enrolled students under 15 by multiplying the projected enrollment rates with the projected population younger than 15, but unfortunately the underlying enrollment rates cannot be obtained from the <em>WC-IIASA dataexplorer</em>.</p></li><li id="note-21"><p>On this see also Wolfgang Fengler (2015) – Will the world reach 10 billion people? &#8211; Brookings Institution.
