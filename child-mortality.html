<ul><li><a href="#child-mortality-is-an-everyday-tragedy-of-enormous-scale-that-rarely-makes-the-headlines">15,000 children die every day &#x2013; Child mortality is an everyday tragedy of enormous scale that rarely makes the headlines </a></li><li><a href="#child-mortality-achieving-the-global-goal-for-2030-would-be-a-huge-achievement-but-we-are-currently-far-away">Child mortality rates have declined in all world regions, but the world is not on track to reach the Sustainable Development Goal for child mortality </a></li><li><a href="#mortality-in-the-past-around-half-died-as-children">Before the Modern Revolution child mortality was very high in all societies that we have knowledge of &#x2013; a quarter of all children died in the first year of life, almost half died before reaching the end of puberty </a></li><li><a href="#child-mortality-around-the-world-since-1800">Over the last two centuries all countries in the world have made very rapid progress against child mortality. From 1800 to 1950 global mortality has halved from around 43% to 22.5%. Since 1950 the mortality rate has declined five-fold to 4.5% in 2015. All countries in the world have benefitted from this progress</a></li><li><a href="#child-mortality-from-the-parents-perspective">In the past it was very common for parents to see children die, because both, child mortality rates and fertility rates were very high. In Europe in the mid 18th century parents lost on average between 3 and 4 of their children</a></li></ul>



<p>Based on this overview we are asking where the world is today &#x2013; where are children dying and what are they dying from?</p>



<ul><li><a href="#where-in-the-world-are-children-dying">5.4 million children died in 2017 &#x2013; Where did these children die? </a></li><li><a href="#what-are-children-dying-from">Pneumonia is the most common cause of death, preterm births and neonatal disorders is second, and diarrheal diseases are third &#x2013; What are children today dying from?</a></li></ul>



<p>This is the basis for answering the question what can we do to make further progress against child mortality? We will extend this entry over the course of 2020.</p>

<p>Child mortality today is the lowest it has ever been. In less than three decades child mortality has more than halved &#x2014; from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5.4 million in 2017. This is a huge accomplishment that should not be overlooked. </p>

<p>Of course, the death of every child is an enormous tragedy, and in many countries far too many children die because of causes we know how to prevent and treat. As the map here shows, today the highest child mortality rates are in Sub-Saharan Africa, where we still have countries with child mortality rates greater than 10% &#x2014; this means that one out of 10 children born never reach their 5th birthday. </p>

How old were they when their lives ended?</p><p>The answer can be seen in the bar chart. It shows all deaths in the world by age in five-year age groups, starting with the youngest on the left towards the oldest age group (95+ years) on the right.</p><p>What stands out is the death toll for the very youngest age-group. 5.4 million children died before they had their fifth birthday. On any average day, that&#x2019;s 15,000 young children.</p><p>The suffering and dying of children remains immense, yet these daily tragedies continue without receiving the attention this injustice deserves. A comparison of the tragedy of child deaths with those tragedies that do receive public attention puts it in perspective. A large jumbo jet can carry up to 620 passengers.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>The number of child deaths is that of 24 jumbo jet crashes, with only children on board, every single day.</p><p>Single events &#x2013; such as plane crashes &#x2013; always make the headlines. Daily tragedies &#x2013; even the worst ones like the deaths of thousands of children &#x2013; never make the headlines.</p><p>Every case of a family losing a child is a tragedy, regardless of how common or uncommon the cause. Spectacular events that grab global attention in the media are not more important than everyday human suffering. But unfortunately this is not how our minds and our media work. What we focus our attention on are either the spectacular tragedies (natural disasters, terrorist attacks, crime) or new problems (fake news, risks from automation). The first category keeps the breaking news cycle running, the second category keeps the op-ed writers employed. But in many aspects the biggest threats to our lives are the same threats that all the generations that came before us have faced. And this seems unfortunately to be true for what kills children around the world; it&#x2019;s neither new nor spectacular.</p><p>A newspaper that would cover the most important facts about the last 24 hours would cover the 15,000 child deaths on its cover page every day.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/05/Deaths-globally-by-age_2017-data-IHME-786x550.png" alt="Deaths globally by age 2017 data ihme" class="wp-image-23516" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/05/Deaths-globally-by-age_2017-data-IHME-786x550.png 786w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/05/Deaths-globally-by-age_2017-data-IHME-150x105.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/05/Deaths-globally-by-age_2017-data-IHME-400x280.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/05/Deaths-globally-by-age_2017-data-IHME-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/05/Deaths-globally-by-age_2017-data-IHME.png"></figure></div></div><h3 id="child-mortality-achieving-the-global-goal-for-2030-would-be-a-huge-achievement-but-we-are-currently-far-away"><a class="deep-link" href="#child-mortality-achieving-the-global-goal-for-2030-would-be-a-huge-achievement-but-we-are-currently-far-away"></a>Child mortality: achieving the global goal for 2030 would be a huge achievement &#x2013; but we are currently far away</h3><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right">

<p>Every country in the world agreed to reach the UN&#x2019;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sdg-tracker.org/good-health#3.2" target="_blank">Goal 3.2</a>&#xA0;is to reduce the child mortality rate to at least as low as 2.5% in all countries by 2030. This would mean that more than 97.5% of all newborns would survive the first five years of their life no matter where they are born.</p>



<p>We are currently far away from the goal for 2030. Globally 3.9% of all children die before reaching the age of five, which means that on average 15,000 children die every day.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>



<p>And the visualization shows that while the child mortality rate declined around the world there are still many countries in which the mortality rate is higher than 2.5%.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>The visualization shows five scenarios for the 15-year period of the SDG era to answer this question.</p>



<p>Stagnation in child health would mean 100 million child deaths in the SDG era. The number of births in the world is&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/peak-child">expected to stagnate</a>&#xA0;between 2015 and 2030 at around 140 million births per year. If we assume the global child mortality rate to remain at the level it was at the beginning of the SDG era (4.5%) then we would live in a world with 6.3 million child deaths every year &#x2013; 100 million child deaths until 2030.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>



<p>Stagnation, however, is not what global health researchers expect. Based on past trends and levels in 2015 the UN Population Division made projections for the number of births and the mortality rate of children in all countries of the world. According to these projections the number of child deaths will be almost two million lower in 2030 than in a stagnating world: 4.5 million child deaths. This improvement of child health would still mean terrible suffering: 86 million child deaths in the SDG era.</p>



<p>And while these UN projections expect a further improvement of global child health this trajectory would fall short of reaching the SDG. The scenario in green shows what it would mean to reach the SDGs. In this scenario I made a projection in which all countries would reduce child mortality to at least 2.5% and meet goal 3.2.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> &#xA0;Reaching the SDG would mean again almost 2 million fewer child deaths when compared with the UN projections.</p>



<p>Some suggest that the UN goals are set in a way that makes them easy to achieve. The motivation is supposedly that the UN defined goals which are easy to reach so that the international organization looks good after achieving them. This is not true.&#xA0;Just how ambitious the child mortality goal is becomes clear when you see it in historical context: The scenario called &#x2018;US path&#x2019; shows what would happen to the global child mortality rate if it would follow the decline of child mortality in the US when the US had a mortality rate of 4.5% (in 1946). And the &#x2018;Western Europe path&#x2019; plays out what would happen if the world would follow the path Western Europe took when it was at that level.</p>



<p>The SDG goal is much more ambitious than what the richest regions in the world have achieved when they had the same level of child health.</p>



<p>We know that it is possible to change the world. Two hundred years ago the child mortality rate was extremely high around the world &#x2013;&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-global-overview">more than 40% of all children died</a>. Since then the child mortality rate has declined more than 10-fold. In &#x2018;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better">The world is much better; The world is awful; The world can be much better</a>&#x2018; I&#x2019;ve written about how we can think about the big gap between the current state of the world and what we know is possible and the big gap between the terrible living conditions in the past and the improvements since then. Because we need to further reduce child deaths&#xA0;we are studying the causes of death of children today and how it was possible to improve child health so very substantially in the past&#xA0;in our&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality">entry on child mortality</a>.</p>



<p>We are currently far away from reaching the global goal for child mortality. Achieving it, however, is tremendously important &#x2013; it would spare millions of families one of the most horrible tragedies anyone can imagine.</p>

Anthony Volk and Jeremy Atkinson<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> set out to answer this question. They brought together quantitative estimates on mortality at a young age from a wide range of geographic locations and cultures, going back many centuries.</p><p>The authors report mortality rates relative to two different age cut-offs:</p><p>&#x2013; The <i>infant mortality rate</i> measures the share who died in their first year of life.</p><p>&#x2013; The <i>youth mortality rate</i> measures the share who died before reaching &#x201C;approximate sexual maturity at age 15&#x201D;.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="historical-estimates-of-mortality"><a class="deep-link" href="#historical-estimates-of-mortality"></a>Historical estimates of mortality</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>This visualization shows the historical estimates Volk and Atkinson brought together from a large number of different studies. Shown with the blue marks are estimates of the share of newborns that died in the first year of life &#x2013; the infant mortality rate. And shown with the red marks you see different estimates of the share that never reached adulthood &#x2013; what we here refer to as the &#x2018;youth mortality rate&#x2019;.</p>



<p>Across the entire historical sample the authors found that on average, 26.9% of newborns died in their first year of life and 46.2% died before they reached adulthood. Two estimates that are easy to remember: Around a quarter died in the first year of life. Around half died as children.</p>



<p>What is striking about the historical estimates is how similar the mortality rates for children were across this very wide range of 43 historical cultures. Whether in Ancient Rome; Ancient Greece; the pre-Columbian Americas; Medieval Japan or Medieval England; the European Renaissance; or Imperial China: Every fourth newborn died in the first year of life. One out of two died in childhood.</p>



<p>The available evidence for the mortality rates of children in hunter-gatherer societies and also for our closest relatives &#x2013; Neanderthals and primates &#x2013; I summarize at the end of this post.</p>



<p>On the very right of the chart you see the statistics on child health in the world today: The global infant mortality rate is now&#xA0;<a href="https://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/neonatal_infant_text/en/">is 2.9%</a>. And 4.6% die before reaching the age of 15.</p>



<p>The global mortality rates over the course of the 20th century are also shown in the chart. Just as recently as 1950 the global mortality rates were five times higher. We have seen a very&#xA0;steep decline during our lifetimes.</p>



<p>The chances of survival for a newborn today are around 10-times higher than the past. But some in countries mortality rates are still much higher than the world average. The country with the highest infant mortality rate is the Central African Republic where close to 9% of all infants die.</p>



<p>The country with the lowest infant mortality rate today is Iceland at 0.16%. The chances of an infant surviving here are 170-times higher than in the past.</p>

Could they all mislead us to believe that mortality rates were higher than they actually were?</p><p>There is another piece of evidence to consider that suggests the mortality of children was in fact very high in much of humanity&#x2019;s history: birth rates were high, but population growth was close to zero.</p><p>The fertility rate was commonly higher than 6 children per woman on average, as we discuss <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#total-fertility-rate-around-the-world-over-the-last-two-centuries">here</a>. A fertility rate of 4 children per woman would imply a doubling of the population size each generation; a rate of 6 children per woman would imply a tripling from one generation to the next. But instead population barely increased: From 10,000 BCE to 1700 the world population grew by only <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#long-run-historical-perspective">0.04% annually</a>. A high number of births without a rapid increase of the population can only be explained by one sad reality: a high share of children died before they could have had children themselves.</p><p>Volk and Atkinson also explain that their historical mortality rates &#x201C;should be viewed as conservative estimates that generally err toward underestimating actual historic rates&#x201D;. A first reason is that death records were often not produced for children, especially if children died soon after birth. A second reason they cite is that child burial remains, another important source, are often incomplete &#x201C;due to the more rapid decay of children&#x2019;s smaller physical remains and the lower frequency of elaborate infant burials&#x201D;.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>And lastly, we find that a large number of independent studies for very different societies, locations, and times come to surprisingly similar assessments: all point to very high mortality rates for children. For societies that lived thousands of kilometers away from each other and were separated by thousands of years of history, mortality in childhood was terribly high in all of them. The researchers find that on average a quarter of infants died before their first birthday and half of all children died before they reached puberty.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="during-the-last-century-the-global-mortality-at-a-young-age-declined-10-fold"><a class="deep-link" href="#during-the-last-century-the-global-mortality-at-a-young-age-declined-10-fold"></a>During the last century the global mortality at a young age declined 10-fold</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>How does the historical data compare with the world today?&#xA0;Globally <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/youth-mortality-rate?tab=chart&amp;time=1990..2017&amp;country=OWID_WRL">95.4%</a> of all children survive the first 15 years of life.</p>



<p>This is a dramatic change from the past. As we&#x2019;ve seen above: The research suggests that in our long history the chances for a child to survive were about fifty-fifty.</p>



<p>The map shows the mortality up to the age of 15 in every country today. By clicking on any country in this map you see the change over time. You will find that the mortality rate declined in every country around the world.</p>



<p>But you also see that in some parts of the world, youth mortality is still very common. Somalia &#x2013; on the Horn of Africa &#x2013; is the country with the highest rate at 14.8%.</p>



<p>And the map also shows the regions with the best health. In the richest parts of the world deaths of children became very rare. In Iceland, the country with the lowest youth mortality, the chances a child survives their first 15 years of life are 99.71%.</p>



<p>The second metric we studied above was the infant mortality rate in the first year of life. Across the historical societies this rate was around a quarter; the global rate today is 2.9%. In <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/infant-mortality">our map for infant mortality</a>&#xA0;you find the data for every country in the the world.</p>



<p>Today&#x2019;s mortality rates of children are still <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better">unacceptably high</a>, but the progress that humanity has achieved is substantial.&#xA0;Our ancestors could have surely not imagined what is reality today.&#xA0;And for me this progress is one of the greatest achievements of humanity.</p>

What about prehistory when our ancestors lived as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a>?</p><p>Good evidence here is much harder to come by. To study mortality at a young age in prehistoric societies the researchers need to mostly rely on evidence from modern hunter-gatherers. Here, one needs to be cautious of how reflective modern societies are of the past. This is because recent hunter-gatherers might have been in exchange with surrounding societies and &#x201C;often currently live in marginalized territories&#x201D;, as the authors say. Both of these could matter for mortality levels.</p><p>To account for this, Volk and Atkinson have attempted to only include hunter-gatherers that are best representative for the living conditions in the past; they limited their sample &#x201C;only to those populations that had not been significantly influenced by contact with modern resources that could directly influence mortality rates, such as education, food, medicine, birth control, and/or sanitation.&#x201D;</p><p>Again, the researchers find very similar mortality rates across their sample of 20 different studies on hunter-gatherer societies from very different locations: The average infant mortality rate (younger than 1) was 26.8% and the average mortality before puberty, 48.8%. Almost exactly the same as the historical sample discussed above.</p><p>All but one of these studied societies are modern hunter-gatherers. The one study on mortality rates of paleolithic hunter-gatherers investigates the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Knoll">Indian Knoll</a> archaeological site from around 2,500 BCE, located in today&#x2019;s area of Kentucky.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p> For this community the estimates suggest that mortality at a young age was even higher than the average for modern-day hunter-gatherers: 30% died in their first year of life, and 56% did not survive to puberty.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="neanderthals-and-primates-the-mortality-of-our-closest-relatives"><a class="deep-link" href="#neanderthals-and-primates-the-mortality-of-our-closest-relatives"></a>Neanderthals and primates &#x2013; the mortality of our closest relatives</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Going beyond our own species (homo sapiens), researchers have also attempted to measure the mortality rates at young ages for our closest relatives.</p><p>Studies that focussed on the Neanderthals, our very closest relatives who lived within Eurasia from circa 400,000 until 40,000 years ago, suggest that they suffered infant mortality rates similar to our species before modernization: it is estimated that around 28% died in the first year of life.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>Atkinson and Volk also compared human child mortality rates across species with other primates. Bringing together many different sources the authors find the mortality rates of young chimpanzees and gorillas to be similar to the mortality rates of humans of the past, while other primates differ: orangutans and bonobos appear to have somewhat lower mortality rates and baboons, macaques, colobus monkeys, vervet monkeys, lemurs and other primates suffer from higher mortality rates.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="child-mortality-around-the-world-since-1800"><a class="deep-link" href="#child-mortality-around-the-world-since-1800"></a>Child mortality around the world since 1800</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="global-child-mortality-since-1800"><a class="deep-link" href="#global-child-mortality-since-1800"></a>Global child mortality since 1800</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Since the beginning of the age of the Enlightenment the mortality of children has declined rapidly. Child mortality in rich countries today is much lower than 1%. This is a very recent development and was only reached after a hundredfold decline in child mortality in these countries. In early-modern times, child mortality was very high; in 18th century Sweden every third child died, and in 19th century Germany every second child died. With declining poverty and increasing knowledge and service in the health sector, child mortality around the world is declining very rapidly: Global child mortality fell from 19% in 1960 to just below 4% in 2017; while 4% is still too high, this is a substantial achievement.</p><p>One reason why we do not hear about how global living conditions are improving in the media is that these are the slow processes that never make the headlines: A century ago every third child died before it was five years old, almost a century later the child mortality rate has fallen to 4%. We will not learn about this development from the news as such a slow development is never fast enough to make a headline. The headline that could have been published on every average day in the last century is&#xA0;&#x201C;The global child mortality rate fell by 0.0008 percentage points&#xA0;since yesterday&#x201D;.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>Big countries like Brazil and China reduced their child mortality rates 10-fold over the last 4 decades. Other countries &#x2013; especially in Africa &#x2013; still have&#xA0;high child mortality rates, but it&#x2019;s not true that these countries are not making progress. In Sub-Saharan Africa, child mortality has been&#xA0;continuously falling for the last 50 years (1 in 4 children died in the early 60s &#x2013; today it is less than 1 in 10). Over the last decade this improvement has been&#xA0;happening faster than ever before. Rising prosperity, rising education and the spread of health care around the globe are the major drivers of this progress.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-child-mortality-timeseries" class="grapherPreview">

It&#x2019;s therefore hard to grasp just how common child deaths were for almost all of our history.</p><p>In the map here we&#x2019;ve visualized the estimated child mortality rate &#x2013; the share of children (born alive) who died before reaching their 5th birthday &#x2013; in 1800, 1950 and 2015.</p><p><strong>1800</strong>: Demographic research suggests that through to at least the year 1800 more than one-third of children failed to reach the age of five. Despite estimates in 1800 coming with substantial uncertainty, it&#x2019;s expected that in some countries rates could have been as high as every 2nd child. Let&#x2019;s think about what this meant for parents of this period. The average woman in 1800 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#total-fertility-rate-around-the-world-over-the-last-two-centuries" target="_blank">had between 5 to 7 children</a>.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p>Parents probably <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality#how-many-children-did-a-woman-give-birth-to-that-died-before-their-5th-birthday" target="_blank">lost 2 or 3 of their children</a> in the first few years of life. Such loss was not a rare occurrence but the norm for most people across the world.</p><p><strong>1950</strong>: By 1950, the outlook has changed dramatically &#x2014; but only for some. For the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/entries/economic-growth">richest countries</a> at the time &#x2014; across Europe, Australasia, North America, and some parts of South America &#x2014; child mortality had fallen to less than 5 percent (1-in-20). The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#total-fertility-rate-around-the-world-over-the-last-two-centuries" target="_blank">fertility rate</a> across these countries had also fallen to around 2 to 3 children per woman. Major improvements in living standards, medical knowledge and care, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">nutrition</a>, water and sanitation, and treatment of disease had transformed outcomes for mothers and children. For the first time in millennia, most parents would not lose a child. Child mortality was still fairly common, but no longer the norm.</p><p>But 1950 was also a divided world. Child mortality rates across the rest of the world were still unimaginably high. With one-in-three children (sometimes higher) dying in their first few years, most parents across Africa, Asia and much of South America were probably still losing several children.</p><p><strong>2015</strong>: If we fast-forward to 2015 we see how far the world has progressed. Child mortality continued to fall across Europe, North America and Australasia; in 2015 around 1-in-200 children died before their 5th birthday. But the rest of the world has also seen dramatic improvements. Many countries across South America, Asia and Africa have reduced child mortality to 1 to 2 percent (between 1-in-50 and 1-in-100). China reduced child deaths from 1-in-3 to 1-in-100; India from 1-in-4 to 1-in-20; Kenya from 1-in-3 to 1-in-20; and Tanzania from greater than 1-in-3 (40 percent) to 1-in-20. The countries where child mortality is highest today have comparable rates to many countries across Europe in 1950.</p><p>Many of us <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wrong-about-the-world">are not aware</a> that child mortality has declined substantially <em>everywhere</em> and&#xA0;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/" target="_blank">still imagine the divided world</a> as it was in 1950. A divided world where progress in the richest countries was dynamic, but static and persistently bad elsewhere.</p><p>As the chart shows, substantial declines in child mortality have occurred across&#xA0;<em>all</em> regions. Average rates in Africa are now lower than the European average in 1950.</p><ul><li>global rates fell five-fold from 22.5 percent to 4.5 percent;</li><li>European rates from 11 to 0.6 percent;</li><li>North American rates from 3.8 to 0.6 percent;</li><li>Oceania rates from 9 to 2.5 percent;</li><li>Latin American rates almost ten-fold from 20 to 2.4 percent;</li><li>Asian rates from 1-in-4 children (25 percent) to below 1-in-20 (3.5 percent);</li><li>African rates from 1-in-3 children (32 percent) to below 1-in-12 (8 percent).</li></ul><p>The frequency of child deaths today (as high as 1-in-7 in the handful of poorest cases) is still tragically high. We must do better. But we also know that we can do better. History has shown that no country is an exception to this.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/3-maps-of-Child-mortality.png" alt="3 maps of child mortality" class="wp-image-23348" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/3-maps-of-Child-mortality.png 3000w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/3-maps-of-Child-mortality-105x150.png 105w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/3-maps-of-Child-mortality-279x400.png 279w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/3-maps-of-Child-mortality-768x1100.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/3-maps-of-Child-mortality-384x550.png 384w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/3-maps-of-Child-mortality.png"><figcaption>[<em>Clicking on the visualization will open it in higher resolution</em>]. </figcaption></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-around-the-world" class="grapherPreview">

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p><em>Here ends the joy of my life&#x2019;</em> ends the diary entry of John Evelyn after the writer&#x2019;s son Richard died on January 27,1658. Evelyn describes in moving words the <em>&#x201C;inexpressible grief and affliction&#x201D;</em> that he and his wife Mary suffered. Richard was their first-born child <em>&#x201C;5 years and 3 days old onely, but at that tender age a prodigy for witt and understanding; for beauty of body a very angel; for endowment of mind of incredible and rare hopes.&#x201D;</em><a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>



<p>Mary and John Evelyn continued to have children together. They had another son, also named Richard, who died at an even younger age, as a newborn. Again they were heartbroken; but it wasn&#x2019;t the end of it. Of their eight children, seven died.</p>



<p>The diary records of other parents tell us of similar hardship. The English politician and barrister William Brownlow and his wife Elizabeth Duncombe had 19 children together. Thirteen of them died. Some periods of their life were particularly tragic: in just eight years between 1638 and 1646 they had seven children. All of them &#x2013; Thomas, Francis, Benjamin, George, James, Maria, and Anne &#x2013; died in a row. The parents&#x2019; heartbreak is obvious from William&#x2019;s diary records: when George, their fifteenth child, died in 1842 his father wrote &#x201C;<em>Thou O God hast broken me asunder and shaken me to pieces&#x201D;</em>.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>



<p>The death of a child has always been the most tragic calamity mothers and fathers could experience.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> How common was it that parents saw their children die?</p>



<p>The visualization presents the best estimates available.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> Shown is the data for Sweden, but you can switch the view to any other country in the world using the option &#x2018;Change country&#x2019;. I am showing Sweden because it is a country for which we have particularly good long-run demographic data. Sweden was the first country to establish an office for population statistics: the <em>Tabellverket</em>, which was founded in 1749.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> </p>



<p>The total height of the orange and purple area shows the average number of children born per woman &#x2013; the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate">fertility rate</a> &#x2013; up to the present.</p>



<p>The area in purple shows the answer to our question; it is the average number of children who died within the first five years of life, per woman. I calculated this by multiplying the number of children per woman by the mortality rate of children under five.</p>



<p>Throughout most of the 19th century Swedish women gave, on average, birth to more than four children. Child mortality in this period was <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality?tab=chart&amp;country=FIN+SWE">around one-in-four</a>, and at times much higher, so that on average every woman lost one child under the age of five.</p>



<p>Every woman losing one child on average is terrible, but in fact this number underestimates the average mother&#x2019;s experience for three reasons: First, many children died when they <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past">were older than five</a> &#x2013; just as the Evelyn&#x2019;s son, Richard; second, this data presents the average number of children per woman, but not every woman was a mother meaning many mothers had (and lost) more children; and third, the data presented here is restricted to the period for which we have better data and these are mostly periods in which the mortality of children had already declined (this is certainly the case for Sweden where the mortality rate was higher than one-in-four in the 18th century).<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>



<p>Going further back in time is possible for some countries &#x2013; I&#x2019;ve done some calculations using estimates from a number of sources. In Sweden, in the mid 18th century, the fertility rate for married women was 7.6 children and the share of children who died before the age of 15 was 44%.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> This means that at the time, the average Swedish mother lost around 3.3 children. For other countries the estimates for the 18th century are similar. In France the average married woman had 8 children and saw around 3.6 of them die; and in the region that is Germany today the average married woman probably saw more than 4 of her children die.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>



<p>With the decline of child mortality and fertility over the last couple of centuries this has changed dramatically, and in rich countries like Sweden these tragic events have become very rare. As the data in the chart shows, for Sweden the average has gone down to 0.006 child deaths per woman. An experience that just a few generations ago was so common, and that almost every woman suffered through it, is now so rare that today it is only a reality for 1-in-180 Swedish women.</p>



<p>In this visualization you can change the country for which this data is shown and explore the trends in countries around the world. To compare the number of children lost per woman for several countries &#x2013; and see the data on a world map &#x2013; you can use <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-died-before-five-per-woman?tab=map&amp;year=2015&amp;time=1800..2015">this visualisation</a>. In most world regions it has become rare for parents to lose a child, but this is unfortunately not true everywhere.</p>

The countries are ordered along the x-axis descending by the country&#x2019;s child mortality rate. This makes it possible to see the child mortality rate for each country. Some countries are labelled, but not all. It is also possible to see which share of the world population had a child mortality rate lower than a given level. For the orange line &#x2013; referring to&#xA0;data from 1950-60 &#x2013; we see that close to 70% of the world population have a child mortality rate of higher than 10% back then.<br></em></p><p>For 1800 (red line), you see that the countries on the very left &#x2013; Yemen, India, and others that are not labelled &#x2013;&#xA0;had a child mortality rate higher than 50%. Every second child died before the age of 5. On the very right of the red line you see that in 1800 the best-off countries in the world had a child mortality rate higher than 30%: Every third child died in the countries with the <em>best</em> health.</p><p>Looking at the orange line, you see that in the following 150 years some countries substantially reduced their child mortality rate: 30% of the world population has a child mortality under 10%. Other countries were stuck in poor health: More than half of the world (57%) had child mortality that were still higher than 20%. The world was clearly divided into developed and developing countries. The rapid progress of the industrialized countries had the consequence that the distribution of global health was hugely unequal.</p><p>The latest data refers to 2013. Global health has improved hugely. Particularly those countries that had the worst health in the 1950s experienced the most dramatic improvements. China for example reduced its child mortality from 28.4% to now 1.3%. The consequence of the faster progress in former developing countries is that global health inequality has fallen since the 1950s.</p><p>The global average child mortality rate (weighted population) was 43.3% in 1800 and now fell to 3.4%. Focusing at global inequality we see that in 1800 health was bad around the world, in the 1950s the world became unequal, and today we are back to higher equality but on a much higher level.</p><p>Comparing the position of countries on the red, orange, green and blue lines also makes it possible to see the change in a single countries: In 1800 every second child in South Korea died, in the 1950s the rate was halved (26%), and today it is down to 2.7%.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>World population by level of child mortality&#xA0;over time, 1800-2013<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_world-population-by-level-of-child-mortality-750x525.png" alt="World population by level of fertility over time, 1950-2050 &#x2013; Max Roser" class="wp-image-5568" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_world-population-by-level-of-child-mortality-750x525.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_world-population-by-level-of-child-mortality-150x105.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_world-population-by-level-of-child-mortality-400x280.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_world-population-by-level-of-child-mortality.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="catch-up-improvements-in-child-mortality"><a class="deep-link" href="#catch-up-improvements-in-child-mortality"></a>Catch-up improvements in child mortality</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>In the chart we compare the period over which it took a range of countries to reduce child mortality from one-third (1-in-3) of children dying before their 5th birthday, down to 1-in-20 (5%).

<section><h2 id="where-and-why-do-children-die-today"><a class="deep-link" href="#where-and-why-do-children-die-today"></a>Where and why do children die today</h2><h3 id="where-in-the-world-are-children-dying"><a class="deep-link" href="#where-in-the-world-are-children-dying"></a>Where in the world are children dying?</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>5.4 million children under five years old died in 2017. The fact that in those countries with the best health, child mortality rates are 10-times lower than the global average <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better">suggests</a> that most of these child deaths are preventable.</p><p>To reduce the number of children dying we need to know two things: where they&#x2019;re dying and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality#child-mortality-by-cause-of-death">what they&#x2019;re dying from</a>. Here we take a look at the first question: where in the world are children dying?</p><p>We mapped the global distribution of child deaths in the somewhat unusual visualization. This type of visualization is called a <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/treemap.html">treemap</a>. Each rectangle&#x2019;s size corresponds to the number of child deaths in a particular region.</p><p>The treemap shows the distribution of child deaths in 1990 and 2017:</p><ul><li>The number of child deaths declined in all but 14 countries from 1990 to 2017: for these countries, the outer box represents 1990 and inner box marks 2017.</li><li>There are 14 countries where the number of child deaths increased: in this case only a single box is shown, representing deaths in 2017.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a></li></ul><p>At a time during which the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#how-many-people-die-and-how-many-children-are-born-every-year">number of births increased</a> globally, the number of child deaths fell. In 1990, 12.6 million under-5s died; this <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-child-deaths-have-halved-since-1990">more than halved to 5.4 million</a> until 2017. Every world region also saw a decline.</p><p>Some countries have achieved a dramatic reduction:</p><ul><li>In India, the number of child deaths fell from 3.4 million to one million;</li><li>In China it fell nine-fold from 1.4 million to less than 160,000;</li><li>In Bangladesh more than five-fold from over 500,000 to 100,000;</li><li>In Ethiopia from 439,000 to 189,000;</li><li>And in Brazil from 235,000 to 43,000.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></li></ul><p>But, some of the countries which have seen the greatest progress are still those where most children are dying today. India has suffered the most child deaths: one million in 2017. This was followed by Nigeria (714,000); Pakistan (400,000); the Democratic Republic of Congo (300,000); Ethiopia (189,000); and China (156,000).</p><p>The total number of children dying depends on two factors: the likelihood a newborn will die in the first years of life and the number of children born. Countries where the most children die are not necessarily those where a child&#x2019;s chances of dying are highest. <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-igme">Here</a></strong> is the map of the mortality rate of children. India has a child mortality rate of around 4% &#x2013; the same as the global <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-igme?tab=chart&amp;country=IND+OWID_WRL">average</a> &#x2013; and three times lower than <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-igme">some of the highest countries in the world</a>. But it has, by far, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-under-five-years-old">largest number of children under five years old</a>.</p><p>This matters for the possibility to make progress in the future. India &#x2013; for example &#x2013; doesn&#x2019;t only have a falling child mortality rate, but has also passed &#x2018;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/peak-child">peak child</a>&#x2019;. The number of children under five years old <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/indias-population-growth-will-come-to-an-end">has already peaked</a> and is now falling: in the coming decades, its <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/change-in-under-5s-2015-to-2050">under-5 population will decline</a>. Fewer children and a lower likelihood of child mortality means we&#x2019;d expect the total number of children dying in India to fall quickly.</p><p>Our concern will then turn towards countries where the chances of child mortality is high, and the number of births increasing. Countries where children are <em><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-igme">most likely to die</a></em> &#x2013; Somalia, Chad, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Mali &#x2013; will all have an <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/change-in-under-5s-2015-to-2050">increasing number of children</a> in the coming decades. Progress on reducing child deaths will here therefore become a race between declining child mortality rates and an increasing number of children.</p><p>But the two runners in the race are not independent: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#increasing-well-being-and-status-of-children">one of the reasons</a> couples have many children is because they do &#x2013; or expect to &#x2013; lose some of them early in life. Our progress on reducing child deaths can therefore be amplified if falling child mortality leads to falling <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate">fertility rates</a>.</p><p>We know that most child deaths today are preventable. They result from causes we know we can tackle. How do we know this? Because we already averted many millions of child deaths in the past few decades. Between 1990 and 2017 the number of children dying each year fell by 7.2 million. By stopping those we know are preventable, we <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better">could save at least another 5 million children</a> every year. We can reach a world with many fewer child deaths than ever <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past">before</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/Child-deaths-treemap-657x550.png" alt="Child deaths treemap" class="wp-image-23724" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/Child-deaths-treemap-657x550.png 657w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/Child-deaths-treemap-150x126.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/Child-deaths-treemap-400x335.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/Child-deaths-treemap-768x643.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/Child-deaths-treemap.png"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="what-are-children-dying-from"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-are-children-dying-from"></a>What are children dying from?</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-leading-causes-of-child-death-globally"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-leading-causes-of-child-death-globally"></a>The leading causes of child death &#x2013; globally</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>In the chart presented here we see the major causes of death of children under 5 in 2017 compared to 1990. This type of chart is called a treemap, where the area of each box represents the total number of child deaths for each specific cause. The total colored area represents the total number of child deaths in 1990: 11.8 million children died back then, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>



<p>As the treemap shows, the boxes representing the numbers for child deaths in 2017 are almost always smaller &#x2013; reflecting the fact that deaths from almost all causes have fallen significantly.<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>



<p>There are two major exceptions: the number of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids#hiv-aids-deaths-by-age-group">deaths from AIDS</a> and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-deaths-from-invasive-non-typhoidal-salmonella">deaths caused by invasive non-typhoidal salmonella</a> (iNTS) has increased. Although those numbers were higher in 2017 than 1990, the deaths from both causes have been decreasing since their peak in 2005.</p>



<p>While the total number of child deaths has more than halved from 11.8 million in 1990 to 5.4 million in 2017, the major causes of child deaths have largely remained the same.</p>



<h4 id="15-of-all-child-deaths-in-2017-pneumonia-and-other-lower-respiratory-diseases"><a class="deep-link" href="#15-of-all-child-deaths-in-2017-pneumonia-and-other-lower-respiratory-diseases"></a>15% of all child deaths in 2017 &#x2013; Pneumonia and other lower respiratory diseases</h4>



<p>Almost every seventh child who died in 2017 died of a lower respiratory infection (LRI), which has remained the leading cause of mortality over the past three decades. Pneumonia is the leading LRI. It is caused primarily by bacterial infections.<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>



<h4 id="12-of-deaths-preterm-births-and-neonatal-disorders"><a class="deep-link" href="#12-of-deaths-preterm-births-and-neonatal-disorders"></a>12% of deaths &#x2013; Preterm births and neonatal disorders</h4>



<p>When we talk about child mortality we usually refer to mortality of children under the age of 5. But of all children who die, most do not come close to their fifth birthday: the younger a child is, the higher the risk of mortality. Three times as many children die in the first year of their lives than in the next four years. And the majority of children who die in their first year <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-deaths-by-life-stage">die in the neonatal period</a>, the first 27 days after birth.</p>



<p>Premature birth (being born before the 37th week of gestation) is one of the major determinants of neonatal mortality and therefore complications arising from preterm birth are usually grouped with the neonatal disorders, as we did in our chart.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>



<p>Children born prematurely are at high risk of having birth injuries, underdeveloped organ failures, and attracting infectious diseases.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>



<h4 id="10-of-deaths-diarrheal-diseases"><a class="deep-link" href="#10-of-deaths-diarrheal-diseases"></a>10% of deaths &#x2013; Diarrheal diseases</h4>



<p>Every tenth child that died in 2017 died because of some diarrheal disease &#x2013; rotavirus infection, cholera, shigellosis and other infectious diseases that result in diarrhea. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that diarrheal diseases are <em>&#x201C;both treatable and preventable&#x201D;.</em><a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>



<p>Clearly, the fact that diarrheal diseases are the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/causes-of-death-in-under-5s">third leading cause</a> of child mortality is simply inexcusable. As we will discuss in another post in this series, an increased coverage of oral rehydration therapy &#x2013; an incredibly simple treatment for diarrhea &#x2013; could help to prevent many of these deaths.</p>



<h4 id="9-of-deaths-congenital-defects"><a class="deep-link" href="#9-of-deaths-congenital-defects"></a>9% of deaths &#x2013; Congenital defects</h4>



<p>While classed separately from neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects are significant contributors to infant mortality as well.<a id="ref-31" class="ref" href="#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a> Congenital defects are defined as physical or genetic abnormalities present at birth and include neural tube defects, heart defects, Down syndrome, microcephaly and others.</p>



<h4 id="45-of-deaths-infectious-diseases"><a class="deep-link" href="#45-of-deaths-infectious-diseases"></a>45% of deaths &#x2013; Infectious diseases</h4>



<p>Infectious diseases have always been one of the major causes of child deaths, but the success of vaccination campaigns and antibiotic availability <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccine-preventable-diseases">has done a great deal</a> to reduce mortality from infectious diseases. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/measles-vaccine-coverage-worldwide-vs-measles-cases-worldwide">Measles vaccination</a> is a perfect example: the number of measles cases has shrunk by 86% since 1990. The WHO has estimated that between 2000 and 2017 measles vaccination has prevented 21.1 million deaths across Africa.<a id="ref-32" class="ref" href="#note-32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>



<p>Today we also have vaccines available for tuberculosis, meningitis, hepatitis, and whooping cough. The best way to protect children against <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria">malaria</a> today is to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria-net-results">provide insecticide treated bednets</a>, but a new malaria vaccine implementation program is also underway. <a id="ref-33" class="ref" href="#note-33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>To understand how we can reduce the number of children dying from pneumonia we need to understand both prevention and treatment.&#xA0;</p>



<p>In the chart we show the number of child deaths from pneumonia which are attributed to various risk factors.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="undernutrition-is-the-major-contributor-to-pneumonia-mortality"><a class="deep-link" href="#undernutrition-is-the-major-contributor-to-pneumonia-mortality"></a>Undernutrition is the major contributor to pneumonia mortality</h4>



<p>Here we see that childhood undernutrition, especially so called &#x2018;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-children-with-a-weight-too-low-for-their-height-wasting">child wasting</a>&#x2019; (children who have a weight too low for their height), is the biggest risk factor for pneumonia in children.<a id="ref-37" class="ref" href="#note-37"><sup>37</sup></a> It contributed to 53% of pneumonia deaths in 2017. Without sufficient energy intake the body cannot cope with increased energy demands required to fight off the infection. </p>



<p>A literature review of pneumonia in malnourished children by Mohammod Jobayer Chisti and colleagues found that undernourished children are between two and four times more likely to be admitted to hospital due to pneumonia and up to 15 times more likely to die from it.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>



<h4 id="air-pollution-and-second-hand-smoke-increase-the-risk-of-getting-pneumonia"><a class="deep-link" href="#air-pollution-and-second-hand-smoke-increase-the-risk-of-getting-pneumonia"></a>Air pollution and second-hand smoke increase the risk of getting pneumonia&#xA0;</h4>



<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution">Indoor air pollution</a> was the risk factor that is estimated to have lead to 29% of pneumonia deaths in 2017. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution">Outdoor air pollution</a> was responsible for another 18% of all deaths.</p>



<p>Studies have shown that high indoor air pollution in households can double the chances a child develops pneumonia and makes recovery less successful.<a id="ref-39" class="ref" href="#note-39"><sup>39</sup></a> One of the underlying reasons for why this is the case is that the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution#exposure-to-particulate-matter">small polluting particles</a> impair the immune system&#x2019;s ability to fight and clear the infection.</p>



<p>Laura Jones et <em>al. </em>(2011) reviewed studies which assessed the impact of secondhand smoke on children, and concluded that children who live in households with smoking parents are more likely to acquire pneumonia as well as other respiratory illnesses. A Global Burden of Disease study by Mattias &#xD6;berg et <em>al.</em> has estimated that in 2004, globally around 40% of children lived in households where at least one close relative smoked.<a id="ref-40" class="ref" href="#note-40"><sup>40</sup></a> The data shown here suggests that the exposure to secondhand smoke led to 61,000 deaths among children under 5 from lower respiratory diseases in 2017.</p>



<h4 id="the-risk-of-pneumonia-is-higher-for-children-with-hiv"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-risk-of-pneumonia-is-higher-for-children-with-hiv"></a>The risk of pneumonia is higher for children with HIV</h4>



<p>Exposure to other pathogens such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#measles-global-vaccination-coverage-and-decline-of-measles">measles</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids">HIV</a> also increases the risk of pneumonia in children. </p>



<p>When children who are infected with HIV develop AIDS &#x2013; which weakens their immune system &#x2013; their chances of dying from pneumonia increase significantly. A study by Evropi Theodoratou et <em>al., </em>published in <em>Lancet Infectious Diseases,</em> found that children with HIV have a seven times greater risk of dying from pneumonia compared to those without it.<a id="ref-41" class="ref" href="#note-41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>



<p>The same study also showed that the proportion of child deaths from pneumonia that can be attributed to HIV varies widely between countries: in 2010 only 1% of all child deaths from pneumonia in India could be directly attributed to HIV, compared to 64% in Swaziland and 62% in Lesotho. In Africa, a total of 3% of cases and 17% of all childhood deaths from pneumonia was attributable to HIV. These regional differences are important to know so that interventions that can save most lives can be prioritized.&#xA0; </p>



<h4 id="overcrowding-facilitates-pneumonia-transmission"><a class="deep-link" href="#overcrowding-facilitates-pneumonia-transmission"></a>Overcrowding facilitates pneumonia transmission&#xA0;</h4>



<p>Pneumonia is not an easily transmittable disease, it requires close contact for the pathogens to be transmitted to another person via air droplets. Therefore overcrowding &#x2013; too many people living in one space &#x2013; also increases the risks of pneumonia. This is yet another reason why pneumonia is a disease of poverty: in 2015, 47% of children in low and middle-income countries were living in overcrowded households.<a id="ref-42" class="ref" href="#note-42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>



<p>Despite progress against it, more than 800,000 children still die from pneumonia each year. We know where children are dying, and the factors that make them vulnerable to the disease. The key question is how we continue to make progress against it.</p>

Hand washing with soap, better water quality and better sanitation have been shown to reduce the risk of diarrheal infections by&#xA0; 47%, 17% and 36%, respectively.<a id="ref-64" class="ref" href="#note-64"><sup>64</sup></a></p><p>Educating mothers about the importance of breastfeeding is also important. Breastfeeding allows for the transfer of maternal immunity to the child &#x2013; in developing countries infants that are not breastfed are six times more likely to die from infectious diseases, such as those causing to diarrhea, in the first 2 months of their lives.<a id="ref-65" class="ref" href="#note-65"><sup>65</sup></a></p><p>Another way to prevent diarrheal diseases is vaccination. Until relatively recently, there were few vaccines available to prevent diarrheal diseases. Cholera vaccine has been licensed since 1991 but it is primarily given to travelers and used as an outbreak control measure. This is because targeted immunization combined with other sanitary measures is more cost-effective than immunizing every individual with a vaccine that only provides a few years of protection.<a id="ref-66" class="ref" href="#note-66"><sup>66</sup></a></p><p> In 2006, however, new vaccines against rotavirus &#x2013; the leading cause of childhood diarrhea as the treemap above shows &#x2013; have been introduced. The most recent studies show that, while the effectiveness of the new rotavirus vaccines vary across different countries, it works well in protecting children against rotavirus disease.<a id="ref-67" class="ref" href="#note-67"><sup>67</sup></a></p><p> We will explore the success, potential and limitations of rotavirus vaccines in an upcoming post.</p><p>When preventative measures fail, several options for the treatment of diarrheal diseases are available, including nutritional interventions and&#xA0;antibiotic use when necessary. But the single best treatment for diarrheal diseases is a surprisingly simple mixture of water, salt and sugar: otherwise known as the oral rehydration solution.<a id="ref-68" class="ref" href="#note-68"><sup>68</sup></a></p><p> The estimates of ORS effectiveness vary by source, with some suggesting that the current use of ORS helps to prevent 69% of diarrheal deaths and, if its coverage would be increased close to 100%, 93% of diarrheal deaths could be prevented.<a id="ref-69" class="ref" href="#note-69"><sup>69</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Potential of interventions to prevent the burden of diarrheal diseases in childhood<a id="ref-70" class="ref" href="#note-70"><sup>70</sup></a></h6><div class="tableContainer"><table id="tablepress-113" class="tablepress tablepress-id-113">

<p>Even after <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria-past-prevalence">a century of progress</a> against malaria, the disease remains devastating for millions. The World Health Organization estimates that 216 million suffered from the disease in 2016.<a id="ref-72" class="ref" href="#note-72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>



<p>Fortunately only a small fraction of malaria victims die of the disease. But those who die are the very weakest; three out of four malaria victims are children younger than 5 years old making it one of the leading causes of child mortality in the world today.<a id="ref-73" class="ref" href="#note-73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="the-world-is-making-progress-against-malaria"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-world-is-making-progress-against-malaria"></a>The world is making progress against malaria</h4>



<p>In the history of improving population health, the most important progress is made in the prevention of disease; for infectious diseases this means interrupting its transmission. But humanity&#x2019;s most ingenious and successful way of transmission interruption &#x2013; immunization through vaccines &#x2013; is not yet available for malaria. However, very recent developments are encouraging; at the time of writing the WHO has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/23/malawi-trial-child-malaria-vaccine-landmark">rolled out</a> a first large-scale trial of a vaccine.<a id="ref-74" class="ref" href="#note-74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>



<p>But we have other weapons in our arsenal.</p>



<p>One line of humanity&#x2019;s attack on the mosquito-borne fever is to progressively reduce the area in which malaria is prevalent. A second one is to prevent the transmission of the parasite where it is still prevalent. It is a surprisingly simple technology that stopped transmission and saved the lives of millions in the last few years alone.</p>



<p>The years since the turn of the millennium were an extraordinarily successful era in the fight against malaria. The series of maps show the incidence of malaria in the world between 2000 and 2017.</p>



<p>From 2000 to 2015 the number of malaria deaths has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-malaria-deaths-by-world-region">almost halved</a>, from 840,000 deaths per year to 440,000, according to the World Health Organization.<a id="ref-75" class="ref" href="#note-75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>



<p>A recent publication in <em>Nature</em><a id="ref-76" class="ref" href="#note-76"><sup>76</sup></a> studied what made this success possible. The focus of the study was Africa, where &#x2013; as the chart shows &#x2013; most of the recent reduction was achieved. The researchers found that the single most important contributor to the decline was the increased distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets. The bed nets protect those who sleep under them.</p>



<p>The insecticide used on the bed nets kills the mosquitoes. So a community where a sufficiently high number of people sleep under bed nets the entire community is protected, regardless of whether they themselves use the bed nets. This is similar to the positive externality effect that vaccination has on communities.</p>



<p>The authors of the <em>Nature </em>study estimate that bed nets alone were responsible for averting 451 million cases of malaria in Africa between 2000 and 2015. The other two interventions that were important for the reduction in the disease burden of malaria were indoor residual spraying (IRS) and the treatment of malaria cases with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). The study&#x2019;s authors estimate that the three interventions averted 663 million cases of malaria in the 15 year period. Insecticide-treated bed nets were by far the most important intervention of the three, preventing 68% of the averted cases.</p>

<p>Progress never happens by itself. For millennia our ancestors were exposed to the malaria parasite without defense; the fact that this changed is the achievement of the scientific and political work of the last few generations.</p>



<p>Today we are in the fortunate situation that we have some decades of progress behind us: We can study what worked and use this knowledge to go further.</p>



<p>To continue the improvement in global health more has to be done, and more can be done. Some of the most important research in global development asks the question where donations can do the most good. It&#x2019;s not always the case that donations do much good. Often it is unfortunately not possible to achieve much progress by donating money because funding is not the limiting constraint or the proposed solution does not actually work. But in some areas we can achieve extraordinary progress by making funding available. A charity evaluator that is doing very rigorous work is &#x2018;GiveWell&#x2019; and on the very top of their <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">recommended charities</a> are two organizations that are fighting malaria &#x2013; the <em>Against Malaria Foundation</em> and the <em>Malaria Consortium</em>.</p>



<p>The diseases many children die from are preventable &#x2013; we therefore know that we can continue this reduction of child mortality, if we choose to do so. What is different from the past and what makes the deaths of children so appalling today is that we now know how to prevent them.</p>



<p>The evidence shows that the fight against malaria is still underfunded; it will depend on this funding and work whether it is possible to continue our progress against it.<a id="ref-77" class="ref" href="#note-77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>



<p>It requires the commitment from governments around the world, but it is also something where each of us individually can contribute. Every one of us can contribute so that we continue to reduce the number of children that die in the world.</p>

So, too, are the interventions to prevent these deaths. Understanding the age at which children die is therefore critical if we&#x2019;re to focus on interventions that will save the most lives.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="children-are-most-likely-to-die-in-the-first-few-days-of-life"><a class="deep-link" href="#children-are-most-likely-to-die-in-the-first-few-days-of-life"></a>Children are most likely to die in the first few days of life</h3><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>In the visualization we see the total number of child deaths by life stage. More than one-third &#x2014; 1.86 million (34.5%) &#x2014; died in the first week of their lives. This is a devastatingly large number: it means that, on average, 5,096 children younger than one week die every day.<a id="ref-79" class="ref" href="#note-79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>



<p>In fact, if we look at the probability of death is the highest in the first 24 hours of life. Newborns are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/10/Probability-of-dying.png">four times more likely to die</a> in the first 24 hours of life than in the next 24 and nine times more likely than on their 7th day of life.<a id="ref-80" class="ref" href="#note-80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>



<h4 id="child-mortality-rates-have-fallen-dramatically-but-the-progress-has-not-been-even-across-all-child-ages"><a class="deep-link" href="#child-mortality-rates-have-fallen-dramatically-but-the-progress-has-not-been-even-across-all-child-ages"></a>Child mortality rates have fallen dramatically, but the progress has not been even across all child ages&#xA0;</h4>



<p>While child mortality has fallen across all age groups, the rate of reduction <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-death-change">has not been even</a>. </p>



<p>The world has been much more successfully in preventing deaths of older children than young infants. Since 1990, mortality has fallen by:</p>



<ul><li>65% for children aged 1 to 4 years old;</li><li>58% for infants (younger than one year);</li><li>49% for neonates (younger than four weeks); and</li><li>39% for babies younger than one week.</li></ul>



<p>Why have we made greater progress in saving older children?&#xA0;</p>



<p>Older children tend to die from diseases such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/childhood-diarrheal-diseases">diarrhea</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-one-year-olds-who-received-the-final-dose-of-pneumococcal-vaccine">pneumonia</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-children-vaccinated-against-measles">measles</a>, and meningitis. These can now be prevented through vaccination. Over the last decades, the world has made <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccine-preventable-diseases">rapid progress</a> in the fight against these <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination">vaccine-preventable</a> diseases. And when a disease can&#x2019;t be prevented, we can also treat children with interventions, such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/oral-rehydration-therapy">oral rehydration therapy</a>.<a id="ref-81" class="ref" href="#note-81"><sup>81</sup></a>&#xA0;</p>



<p>But the causes of death in the youngest children are very different. Pre- and post- birth complications &#x2013; which are the major cause of death in the early days of life &#x2013; cannot be directly prevented by these types of interventions.</p>



<h4 id="more-focus-is-needed-on-mortality-in-the-first-days-of-life"><a class="deep-link" href="#more-focus-is-needed-on-mortality-in-the-first-days-of-life"></a>More focus is needed on mortality in the first days of life</h4>



<p>This means that as child mortality rates decline across the world, our attention must turn increasingly towards saving babies in the first days of life. We need to make much faster progress in addressing neonatal causes of death.</p>



<p>Neonatal deaths can be prevented by provision of basic care for mothers and newborns. Over the past decades the coverage of many of these interventions has increased: more women <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/antenatal-care-coverage">receive antenatal care</a>, more births are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/births-attended-by-health-staff-sdgs?time=2000..2014&amp;country=OWID_WRL">attended by a skilled healthcare worker</a>, more newborns are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/exclusive-breastfeeding">exclusively breastfed</a>.&#xA0;</p>



<p>But the coverage of these and other interventions is still far from sufficient. In 2014 the coverage of simple thermal care for newborns was just 11%; coverage of syphilis detection and treatment in neonates was just 23%; only 49% of births were delivered using clean birth practices; and just 8% of newborns with infections received oral antibiotics.<a id="ref-82" class="ref" href="#note-82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>



<p>If we&#x2019;re to continue the progress against childhood mortality we need to increase our focus on interventions that can protect the youngest among us. </p>

But why?<br> <br>First of all, </span><b>boys are more likely to be born prematurely</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the share of boys born before full-term pregnancy is higher than for girls.</span><a id="ref-103" class="ref" href="#note-103"><sup>103</sup></a>&#xA0;This occurs naturally, but is exacerbated by the rate of induced preterm births. Boys tend to have a higher birthweight than girls &#x2013; which can increase the risk of waiting to term to deliver &#x2013; meaning that more boys are induced before the end of the pregnancy term.<a id="ref-104" class="ref" href="#note-104"><sup>104</sup></a>&#xA0;The chart above shows that more boys die from preterm births. The fact that preterm births are more common for boys contributes to this.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although boys are, on average, heavier than girls at birth, </span><b>they are less physiologically mature at birth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This means they are at higher risk of having delayed physiological function (such as lung function) and adverse neurological outcomes.</span><a id="ref-105" class="ref" href="#note-105"><sup>105</sup></a><a id="ref-106" class="ref" href="#note-106"><sup>106</sup></a>&#xA0;For example, poorer lung function in newborn boys has been shown for both term and preterm infants.<a id="ref-107" class="ref" href="#note-107"><sup>107</sup></a><a id="ref-108" class="ref" href="#note-108"><sup>108</sup></a>&#xA0;Studies have suggested that even in the case of straightforward pregnancies, lung maturation in boys lags that of girls by approximately one week.<a id="ref-109" class="ref" href="#note-109"><sup>109</sup></a>&#xA0;These differences in maturity at birth are not restricted to lung function.<a id="ref-110" class="ref" href="#note-110"><sup>110</sup></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this difference has been an important question for decades &#x2013; the answer is still not clear. But there are some leading hypotheses: surfactant production for lung function has been observed earlier in female fetuses, leading to improved airway flow in the lungs; estrogen has been shown to affect lung development positively in females; males, on average, have a higher birthweight meaning they may trade-off increased size for functional development; and the uterus may be less hospitable to male fetuses &#x2013; the introduction of a Y chromosome in females can create and immunoreactive response to the central nervous system.</span><a id="ref-111" class="ref" href="#note-111"><sup>111</sup></a><a id="ref-112" class="ref" href="#note-112"><sup>112</sup></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, combined with a higher risk of premature birth may explain why boys have higher rates of asphyxia, respiratory infections and birth defects.</span></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="boys-are-at-higher-risk-of-infectious-diseases"><a class="deep-link" href="#boys-are-at-higher-risk-of-infectious-diseases"></a>Boys are at higher risk of infectious diseases</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boys are also at higher risk of infectious diseases such as syphilis,</span> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria"><span style="font-weight: 400;">malaria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, respiratory infections, tetanus and diarrheal diseases. This is more generally true for a broad range of infections, spanning person-to-person, vector-borne, blood-borne, and food and water borne diseases.</span><a id="ref-113" class="ref" href="#note-113"><sup>113</sup></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see this clearly when we compare mortality rates for boys and girls in the earlier chart. But why are boys more susceptible to infection?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, boys have weaker immune systems. There are two key hypotheses for why.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The Y-chromosome in boys increases their vulnerability.</b> Biologically, males and females are differentiated by chromosomes: females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Having two X chromosomes means that the newborn has a stronger immune system because X chromosomes contain a larger number of immune-related genes.</span><a id="ref-114" class="ref" href="#note-114"><sup>114</sup></a><a id="ref-115" class="ref" href="#note-115"><sup>115</sup></a>&#xA0;This means that, since females have two X chromosomes, they have a stronger immune response; boys on the other hand, are more vulnerable to X-linked infections.<a id="ref-116" class="ref" href="#note-116"><sup>116</sup></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes males more vulnerable to many infectious diseases. They are also more susceptible to specific genetic diseases where the defective genes are carried on either the X or Y chromosomes; this is because boys have only one X chromosome so a single recessive gene on that X chromosome results in the disease.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the stronger immune response of females comes with a cost. It&#x2019;s the reason why women are more susceptible to autoimmune disorders such as HIV/AIDS.</span><a id="ref-117" class="ref" href="#note-117"><sup>117</sup></a></p><p><b>Sex hormones may be another key reason for weaker immune systems in males. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Males have much higher amounts of testosterone which seem to inhibit two major parts of the immune system &#x2013; B and T-lymphocytes.</span><a id="ref-118" class="ref" href="#note-118"><sup>118</sup></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estrogen, on the other hand, acts as an effective regulator of this. Overall, male hormones weaken the immune system relative to females.</span></p><p><strong>The male disadvantage</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that boys are more susceptible than girls to a range of health conditions is often summarized as the &#x201C;male disadvantage&#x201D;. This is not restricted to childhood: the female advantage carries into adulthood. It&#x2019;s part of the reason </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-women-live-longer-than-men"><span style="font-weight: 400;">why women tend to live longer than men</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leading explanations for the &#x201C;male disadvantage&#x201D; lie in the biological differences between the sexes. More specifically, differences in maturity, sex chromosomes, and hormones.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In circumstances where both sexes are treated equally, we would therefore expect infant and child mortality rates to be slightly higher for boys.</span></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="child-mortality-and-income-level"><a class="deep-link" href="#child-mortality-and-income-level"></a>Child mortality and income level</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>As one would expect, income level of the country is extremely correlated with child mortality rate.

This shows the mean years of schooling for those aged 15 and older, versus, the share of children who die before reaching the age of five. Overall we see that as the average years of education increase, child mortality declines.<br></p><p>The next chart here from is from Emmanuela Gakidou et <em>al.</em>, who find that over half the decline seen in child mortality globally between 1970-2010 can be explained by improvements&#xA0;in the education of women. What is more, they find that economic&#xA0;growth (GDP) can only explain a very small amount of the reduction in child mortality.</p><p>An explanatory note from the authors says: &#x201C;The lines represent the actual child mortality rate (blue); estimated child mortality rate if GDP for each country had remained at the level it was in 1970 or 1990 (green); estimated child mortality rate if education of reproductive-age women for each country had remained at the level it was in 1970 or 1990 (red); and estimated child mortality rate if both GDP and education of reproductive-age women had remained at their 1970 or 1990 levels (purple).&#x201D;</p><p>Higher educational attainment by mothers is associated with lower child mortality rates within countries. This is shown in the final chart in this section. For instance, Niger has the highest national average of child mortality, but within the country, mothers with a secondary school education or higher experience child mortality rates that are lower than the national averages of the next 16 countries listed.</p><p>The effect of education on child mortality is huge. Especially in places with relatively little education, the prospects for extending education are promising. In 2008, 4.4 million children younger than 5 years died in sub-Sahran Africa. The UNESCO estimates that an extension of secondary education for all women would save 1.8 million children per year.<a id="ref-126" class="ref" href="#note-126"><sup>126</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="/grapher/correlation-between-child-mortality-and-mean-years-of-schooling-for-those-aged-15-and-older" class="grapherPreview">

On the x-axis we measure how many infants, who were born alive, survive their 1st year of life &#x2013; this is the <em>infant survival rate.</em></p><p>The chart shows how these two aspects changed over the course of the 20th century: At the beginning of the century all 4 countries can be found in the upper left corner &#x2013; they are characterized by high fertility and an infant survival rate below 85%. If we follow the 4 lines we are taken to the bottom right corner and see that women have fewer children when the mortality rate of babies goes down.</p><p>The causal link between infant survival and fertility is established in both directions: Firstly, increasing infant survival reduces the parents&#x2019; demand for children. And secondly, a decreasing fertility allows the parents to devote more attention and resources to their children.</p><p>This link between fertility and child mortality is an immensely important insight and tells us what drives the acceleration and slowdown of population growth: In the initial stage of the transition, when fertility rates are still high but health is already improving, the population starts to grow. But then, a bit later, we see that this transition works to decrease population growth since improving health of the children leads to lower fertility. It is an important part of the mechanism behind the <a href="/world-population-growth/#the-demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>.</p><p>A very cynical view is that a decrease in child mortality is bad for the world since it would contribute to the overpopulation of the planet. The chart above shows that this opinion is not just&#xA0;contemptuous of human life but plainly wrong: When more infants survive fertility goes down and the temporary population growth comes to an end. If we want to ensure that the world&#x2019;s population increase comes to an end soon we must work to increase child survival.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Infant survival and fertility through time<a id="ref-129" class="ref" href="#note-129"><sup>129</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_scatter-fertility-vs-infant-survival-750x536.png" alt="Scatter-Fertility-vs-Infant-Survival" class="wp-image-7368" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_scatter-fertility-vs-infant-survival-750x536.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_scatter-fertility-vs-infant-survival-150x107.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_scatter-fertility-vs-infant-survival-400x286.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_scatter-fertility-vs-infant-survival-768x548.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_scatter-fertility-vs-infant-survival.png"></figure></div></div></div></section>
