class="content-and-footnotes"><div class="article-content"><section><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Taxation is by and large the most important source in nearly all countries. According to the most recent estimates from the <a href="http://www.ictd.ac">International Centre for Tax and Development</a>, total tax revenues account for more than 80% of total government revenue in about half of the countries in the world &#x2013; and more than 50% in almost every country.</p><p>We begin this entry by providing an overview of historical changes in taxation patterns, and then move on to an analysis of available data from the last couple of decades, discussing recent trends and patterns in taxation around the world.</p><p>From a historical perspective, the growth of governments and the extent to which they are able to collect revenues from their citizens, is a striking economic feature of the last two centuries. The available long-run data shows that in the process of development, states have increased the levels of taxation, while at the same time changing the patterns of taxation, mainly by providing an increasing emphasis on broader tax bases.</p><p>Taxation patterns around the world today reveal large cross-country differences, especially between developed and developing countries. In particular, developed countries today collect a much larger share of their national output in taxes than do developing countries; and they tend to rely more on income taxation to do so. Developing countries, in contrast, rely more heavily on trade taxes, as well as taxes on consumption.</p><p>Moreover, the data shows that developed countries actually collect much higher tax revenue than developing countries despite comparable statutory taxation rates, even after controlling for underlying differences in economic activity. This suggests that cross-country heterogeneity in fiscal capacity is largely determined by differences in compliance and efficiency of tax collection mechanisms. Both of these factors seem to be affected by the strength of political institutions.</p><p>In the last part of this entry we provide an overview of empirical evidence regarding the equity and efficiency implications of taxation. In particular, we show that taxation does have a powerful redistributive effect, but it is important to consider how taxation also affects behavior of individuals, by changing economic incentives. For example, recent studies have found that taxation may lead to efficiency losses by inducing migration of &#x2018;super stars&#x2019;. These potential efficiency losses highlight the importance of designing taxation systems that achieve redistributive objectives at the smallest possible cost.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="block-wrapper" data-reactroot><div data-variation="full-width" class="wp-block-owid-additional-information"><h3 id="all-our-charts-on-taxation"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="angle-right" class="svg-inline--fa fa-angle-right fa-w-8 " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M224.3 273l-136 136c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.6-22.6c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l96.4-96.4-96.4-96.4c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L54.3 103c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l136 136c9.5 9.4 9.5 24.6.1 34z"/></svg>All our charts on Taxation</h3><div style="height:0;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" class="rah-static rah-static--height-zero"><div style="transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;-webkit-transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;opacity:0"><div class="content">

In the period 1920-1980 taxation as a share of national income increased drastically, more than doubling across all countries in the chart.

And at the other extreme, we have countries such as Libya and Saudi Arabia, where taxes account for less than 2% of national income.</p><p>More generally, this map shows that there is a clear correlation between GDP and tax revenues &#x2013; richer countries tend to collect through taxes a much larger share of their domestic production.

In many cases, especially among upper-middle income countries, tax revenues have been going up consistently. The case of Turkey stands out: in 1980 it collected about 13.5% of GDP in taxes (about half of the US), yet by 2001 it had nearly doubled tax revenues &#x2013; almost catching up with the US.</p><p>In any case, despite specific cases such as Turkey, differences today remain large and there is no clear evidence of global convergence. In many developing countries levels are very low and trends have not been persistently going up by a significant margin.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-tax-revenues-gdp?tab=map" class="grapherPreview">

Now we focus on differences in the <em>composition</em> of tax revenues.</p><p>The visualization presents a breakdown of tax revenue sources, comparing figures from 1986 and 1996. The estimates are provided for a selection of country groups (you can switch country groups by clicking on the option &#x2018;change country group&#x2019;), and are expressed as a share of GDP. The data comes from Todaro and Smith (2014)<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a>, and includes direct taxes (corporate and income taxes), as well as indirect taxes (general, commodity and excise taxes) and social security contributions.</p><p>Although these estimates are somewhat dated, they do provide a rough idea of taxation patterns by world regions. As it can be seen, developing countries depend significantly on indirect taxes, particularly taxes on trade and consumption. This can be contrasted with the case of OECD countries, where direct taxation &#x2013; especially personal income taxation &#x2013; is comparatively more important.</p><p>It is also worth noting the important role of social security revenues in advanced economies: at 10% of GDP in 1996, social security revenues are almost 10 times larger than in developing countries.</p><p>More recent data suggests that direct taxation, and specifically income taxation, remains more important in developed countries than in developing countries. The visualization plots total revenue from taxes on income and profits (horizontal axis) against revenue from taxes on goods and services (vertical axis). Estimates comes from the <a href="http://www.ictd.ac">International Centre for Tax and Development</a> and are expressed as share of GDP.</p><p>As we can see, there is a positive correlation on the aggregate, and European countries (marked in yellow) are consistently located further towards the top right.</p><p>It can also be checked that most countries in the OECD are close, or below a hypothetical line with slope equal to one (i.e. feature higher income tax revenues than commodity tax revenues); Denmark is an extreme case, with income tax revenues more than doubling receipts from taxes levied on goods and services.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/composition-of-tax-revenues-regional?country=Developing%20-%20All&amp;stackMode=stacked" class="grapherPreview">

This measure, usually known as the &#x2018;top marginal rate of taxation&#x2019;, corresponds to the tax rate that applies to the &#x2018;last dollar&#x2019; of income earned by the rich.</p><p>The two visualizations provide evidence of how top marginal income tax rates have evolved around the world.</p><p>The first graph shows top marginal rates in France, Germany, the US and the UK, for the period 1900-2013. As we can see, at the turn of the 20th century the top earners in these countries faced almost zero taxation on the last part of their incomes; but this changed drastically around 1910-1930, when high top marginal rates were introduced. Interestingly, however, this lasted only until about 1980, when again all countries substantially reduced rates. Today the levels are between half and a third of what they used to be at the highest point. In the UK, in 1978 the last pound of earned income at the highest bracket was essentially entirely taxed (98%). Today the corresponding figure is less than half (45%).</p><p>The second graph shows estimates of top marginal income tax rates for a larger selection of countries (years 1979 and 2002). As we can see, the sharp trend of reducing top marginal tax rates after the 1980s was a global phenomenon, expanding both developed and developing countries.</p><p>The interpretation of these graphs often leads to confusion. A common mistake is to interpret the top marginal tax rate as the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/#how-do-marginal-rates-of-taxation-compare-to-average-rates-of-taxation-in-the-us"><em>effective</em> rate of taxation</a> applied to the rich. This is incorrect, because the top marginal rate applies (as the &#x2018;marginal&#x2019; name suggests) only to the last portion of income earned by the rich. And by implication, lower marginal rates do not directly imply lower economic incidence of taxation for the rich.</p><p>Having said that, additional evidence does seem to suggest that the above-mentioned reduction of top marginal income tax rates has been one of the ingredients contributing to lower effective tax rates for the rich. We discuss this additional evidence in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/#how-progressive-is-taxation-at-the-top-of-the-income-distribution-in-developed-countries">next section</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-side-by-side"><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/top-income-tax-rates-piketty" class="grapherPreview">

In the US, for example, if a married couple earns $40,000 a year, they pay federal income taxes at a rate of 10% on the first $18,500 or so, and at a rate of 15% on the rest.

This implies that, to assess who bears the burden of a tax, it is not sufficient to look at statutory tax rates. For example, if a tax is imposed on producers, in a competitive market they will raise prices to some extent to offset this tax burden &#x2013; so the producers&#x2019; income will not fall by the full amount of the tax. A similar argument can be made if the tax is levied on consumers, since in a market economy the tax will lower demand, and this will have a consequence also for producers.</p><p>The key point is that, in order to analyze the economic incidence of taxation in a market economy, we need to look beyond statutory tax rates. Below we provide concrete examples of how economists try to estimate the economic incidence of taxation.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-much-taxes-do-rich-households-pay-in-the-us"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-much-taxes-do-rich-households-pay-in-the-us"></a>How much taxes do rich households pay in the US?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>In the US, the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361">Congressional Budget Office (CBO)</a> produces estimates of the incidence of taxation across the population. To do this, they make the following assumptions: (i) Taxes on earnings are borne by workers; (ii) Taxes on individual income are borne by the households that pay them; (iii) <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/revenue-from-corporate-income-taxes-gdp" target="_blank">Taxes on corporate income</a> are borne by individuals in proportion to their capital income; (iv) Taxes on consumption are borne by individuals in proportion to their consumption.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p>Based on these assumptions, the CBO calculates total tax contributions as a share of pre-tax income for different segments of the pre-tax income distribution.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> These estimates, often referred to as &#x2018;average tax rates&#x2019;, can be interpreted as the effective rates of taxation that apply to individuals with different incomes, after accounting for government transfers (specifically cash payments and in-kind benefits from social insurance and other government assistance programs).</p><p>The visualization, plotting CBO estimates of average tax rates, shows that the federal tax system in the US has been generally progressive: those located higher in the ranking of incomes, pay a higher share of their income in taxes.</p><p>Across time, we can also see that progressivity has not been constant &#x2013; the period 1980-1990 saw important reductions in tax rates for the rich, without comparable reductions for the poor.</p><p>The hike in tax rates towards the end corresponds primarily to significant changes in tax rules in 2012. Up until that point, and since around 1995, tax rates for the richest 1% went down every year (although they also went down for the lower income groups in the same period).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Average federal tax rates, by before-tax income Group, 1979 to 2013 &#x2013; Figure 2 in CBO (2016)<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-750x469.png" alt="usincidence_cbo" class="wp-image-8856" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-750x469.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-150x94.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-400x250.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-progressive-is-taxation-at-the-top-of-the-income-distribution-in-developed-countries"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-progressive-is-taxation-at-the-top-of-the-income-distribution-in-developed-countries"></a>How progressive is taxation at the top of the income distribution in developed countries?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The visualization above shows that, according to the estimates from the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361">Congressional Budget Office</a>, richer individuals in the US generally tend to bear a larger burden of taxation than the poor. Here we examine whether this is also true within the top of the income distribution &#x2013; that is, whether the &#x2018;ultra rich&#x2019; shoulder a larger tax burden than the &#x2018;rich&#x2019;.</p><p>The next visualisation, from Piketty and Saez (2007)<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> shows estimated average tax rates in France, the US and the UK, at two points in time: 1970 and 2005. Notice that these are <em>average</em> rates (i.e. total tax contributions as a share of pre-tax income), <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/#how-do-marginal-rates-of-taxation-compare-to-average-rates-of-taxation-in-the-us">which are different to marginal tax rates</a>.</p><p>Displayed are rates for the bottom 90% of the income distribution, as well as higher percentiles. Again, we can see in these estimates that the systems in question are progressive &#x2013; increasingly higher percentiles in the income distribution pay increasingly higher effective rates of taxation. However, the lines are much flatter in 2005, which shows that the systems have become less progressive at the top: the average share of income paid by those at the very top of the income distribution has dropped substantially since 1970. This is important because, as the authors of the figure point out, over the same period pre-tax income inequality grew significantly: a few very rich individuals at the very top are accumulating an increasingly large share of national incomes.</p><p>An important point that should be kept in mind is that these estimates are not directly comparable to those from the Congressional Budget Office discussed above, because they do not take into account government transfers, and rely on different methodological assumptions &#x2013; for example, they do not consider excise taxes (but they do consider estate taxes).

As we can see, countries with strong executive constraints collect higher tax revenues, when income per capita is held constant, than do countries with weak executive constraints.</p><p>Some studies suggest that, under weak accountability, countries may not only have generally weak taxation systems, but may also be subject to &#x2018;political budget cycles&#x2019; whereby tax collection declines prior to elections, as politicians seek to secure short-term political support (See Prichard 2016<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a> and the references therein for more details).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Tax revenue vs constraints on executive authority</h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-730x550.png" alt="taxes_institutions_besley2013" class="wp-image-8840" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-730x550.png 730w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-150x113.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-400x301.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-768x578.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013.png 1538w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="aid-correlates-negatively-with-tax-revenue-but-the-link-does-not-seem-to-be-causal"><a class="deep-link" href="#aid-correlates-negatively-with-tax-revenue-but-the-link-does-not-seem-to-be-causal"></a>Aid correlates negatively with tax revenue, but the link does not seem to be causal</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>A large body of academic literature has studied the relationship between revenue from development assistance (&#x2018;foreign aid&#x2019;) and revenue from taxation. The hypothesis supporting this strand of literature is straightforward: foreign assistance may &#x2018;crowd out&#x2019; domestic tax revenues, as it reduces the incentives for policy-makers to pursue politically costly tax collection.</p><p>This hypothesis seems to be supported by raw correlations. The plot, from Benedek et al. (2014)<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a>, shows the evolution of tax revenues and foreign aid (Overseas Development Assistance &#x2013; ODA). It shows a broad negative association: between 1980 and 1995, when foreign aid as a share of GDP was increasing, average tax revenue in relation to GDP decreased slightly. Post-1995, a decline in the share of total net ODA to GDP was accompanied by higher tax revenues as percentage of GDP.</p><p>This relationship cannot be interpreted causally, as there are many factors that simultaneously drive ODA flows and tax revenues. More complex econometric studies that try to account for further sources of bias find that there is no consistently significant relationship between aid and tax collection (see Prichard 2016<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a> and the references therein for more details).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Average net development assistance and tax revenue in low and middle income countries, 1980&#x2013;2009 &#x2013; Figure 1 in Benedek et al.

<section><h2 id="the-consequences-of-taxation"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-consequences-of-taxation"></a>The consequences of taxation</h2><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="taxation-is-an-important-instrument-to-reduce-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#taxation-is-an-important-instrument-to-reduce-inequality"></a>Taxation is an important instrument to reduce inequality</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>One way to gauge the extent to which taxation redistributes resources between individuals in a country, is by looking at how the distributions of incomes change before and after taxes. The visualization does this, showing the reduction of inequality that different OECD countries achieve through taxes and transfers.</p><p>The estimates correspond to the percentage point reduction in inequality, as measured by changes in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">Gini coefficients</a> of income, before and after taxes and transfers. The source for the data is the 2016 OECD Inequality Update as part of the OECD Income Distribution Database (IDD) <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/income-distribution-database.htm"><em>November 2016 Release: Income inequality remains high in the face of weak recovery</em></a>. The IDD provides further details regarding how these estimates are constructed. In a nutshell, income &#x2018;before taxes&#x2019; corresponds to what is usually known as market income (wages and salaries, self-employment income, capital and property income); while income after taxes and transfers corresponds to disposable income (market income, plus social security, cash transfers and private transfers, minus income taxes).</p><p>The data shows that across the 35 countries covered, taxes and transfers lower income inequality by around one-third on average (equivalent to around 0.15 Gini points). Yet cross-country differences are substantial, with declines ranging from about 40% in Denmark and Ireland, to about 8% in South Korea. The US &#x2013; a country with high baseline levels of inequality &#x2013; achieves a reduction of around 17%, which is a little over half of the OECD average.</p><p>Generally speaking, countries that achieve the largest redistribution through taxes and transfers tend to be those with the lowest after-tax inequality.</p><p>While informative for the purpose of cross-country comparisons, these results have to be interpreted carefully, since the before-tax distribution of incomes is already the result of choices made by individuals who take taxes and transfers into consideration. Put simply, the before-tax distributions of incomes are likely to be different to the actual distributions of incomes that would be in place if there were no taxes or transfers. This can be clearly explained in the context of pensions: individuals receiving state pensions appear in the data as poor before transfers; but many of them would of course have private pensions if they lived in a country without state transfers.</p><p>The extent to which taxes affect behavior is discussed in more detail <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/#taxation-can-lead-to-efficiency-losses">below</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/tax-reduction-in-inequality" class="grapherPreview">

For example, if a taxed good has a substitute that is not taxed, some consumers will shift to the substitute to avoid the tax. These changes in behavior can lead to inefficiencies. For example, high tax rates may discourage labor supply; and in the case of very rich individuals, they may even induce migration of talent to countries where the tax burden is lower. In both cases, the &#x2018;size of the pie&#x2019; would be reduced by taxation. So how large are these behavioral responses?</p><p>Using data from the European football market, Kleven et al (2013)<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a> find evidence of strong mobility responses to taxation for &#x2018;superstars&#x2019;.
