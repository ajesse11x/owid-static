<section><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Over the last century countries around the world have made huge progress in the expansion of schooling: While in 1870 there were just a few countries in which the average person had <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-years-of-schooling-selected-countries?tab=map&amp;year=1870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 4 years of education</a>, today there are few countries in which the population has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-years-of-schooling-selected-countries?tab=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less education than that</a>. This expansion continues until today &#x2013; just in the last two decades the number of out-of-school children <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/primary-and-secondary-education#the-decline-of-out-of-school-children">almost halved globally</a>.</p><p>This expansion in schooling has been <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well documented</a>, and it is undoubtedly a great achievement. But schooling is not the same as learning. So how are global learning outcomes changing over time? What progress have we made on education quality, and what are the challenges going forward?</p><p>Here are four charts that give us a global perspective. The data comes from a new research paper by Nadir Altinok, Noam Angrist and Harry Patrinos. At the bottom of this post we explain their underlying sources and approach.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="chart-1-a-comparison-of-learning-outcomes-country-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#chart-1-a-comparison-of-learning-outcomes-country-by-country"></a>Chart 1: A comparison of learning outcomes, country by country</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Chart 1 shows that learning outcomes tend to be much higher in richer countries; but differences across countries are very large, even among countries with similar income per capita.</p><p>Here incomes are measured by GDP per capita (after adjusting for differences in prices across countries and time), and learning outcomes are measured by average student test scores (after homogenizing and pooling international and regional student assessments across education levels and subjects). Each bubble in this chart is a country, where colours represent regions and bubble sizes denote population.</p><p>This way of visualizing the data shows that average learning outcomes in poorer countries are lower than in richer countries: The top-performing country in Sub-Saharan Africa has a lower average score than the lowest-performing country in Western Europe.</p><p>Asian countries seem to outperform countries from other regions, followed by North America and Europe; Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern Africa are the next best performers, and Sub-Saharan Africa ranks last.</p><p>Low achievement can arise for many reasons.&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/teachers-and-professors#teacher-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Absent and unqualified teachers</a>, combined with poor complementary inputs, such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/percentage-of-primary-schools-with-toilets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhealthy environments</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poor nutrition</a>, can&#xA0;all play a role.</p><p>Additionally, often some of the most capable students in poor countries migrate. This selective aspect of migration can lead to lower scores in poor countries, while increasing them in richer countries where these talented students end up going to school.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/learning-outcomes-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview">

This is a great accomplishment! It shows that policies matter and learning outcomes can, and often do improve.</p><p>The error margin on these differences is often large, so small deviations from the diagonal line are not significant.</p><p>But it is worrying that many low-performing countries are substantially below the diagonal line.

Better education lifts all boats.</p><p>Low-income, low-performing countries are clustered at the bottom of the global scale: the distribution of test scores within these countries is shifted down, relative to high-performing countries. The challenges are therefore much larger in these countries. Less than half of students in Sub-Saharan Africa reach the minimum global threshold of proficiency; and very, very few students achieve advanced skills.</p><p>Rich countries, on the other hand, tend to be less clustered. For example, Belgium and Canada have roughly similar average outcomes; but Canada has a higher share of students that achieve minimum proficiency, while Belgium has a larger share of students who achieve advanced proficiency. This shows that there is significant information that average scores fail to capture. The implication is that it&#x2019;s not enough to focus on average outcomes to assess challenges in education quality.</p><p>You can compare achievement above minimum, intermediate, and advanced benchmarks, country by country and over time, in these three line charts:</p><ul>

What do we really learn from test scores anyway?</p><p>We have lots of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#private-returns-to-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good evidence on the private benefits from education</a>. Education helps people be more productive and get better-paid jobs. And education also has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#social-returns-to-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">positive spill-over effects on society</a>. For example, there is evidence of positive social returns in terms of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#women-s-education-is-inversely-correlated-with-child-mortality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child mortality</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/corruption#what-is-the-relationship-between-corruption-and-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corruption</a>.</p><p>But the data here shows that, if we want to increase education, it&#x2019;s not enough to send kids to school. It&#x2019;s important that attending school also translates into acquiring specific skills.</p><p>The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#education-outcomes-predict-economic-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence</a> shows that it is actually education in the form of skills, rather than mere school attainment, what really matters for predicting individual earnings and economic growth &#x2013; and standardized tests are an imperfect but informative way of measuring skills.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>In the fourth and final chart we show the correlation between learning outcomes and GDP per capita over time. Each line in this plot tracks one country. As we can see most lines point north-east &#x2013; this means GDP and learning outcomes often move together. Conditioning on baseline levels of GDP and schooling, the correlation is even stronger (see, for example, <a href="https://slides.ourworldindata.org/edu_key_charts/part_6/correlates#/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this chart from Hanushek and Woessmann</a> using a similar dataset).<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/learning-outcomes-vs-gdp-per-capita?time=1970..2015" class="grapherPreview">

There are several international standardised tests that try to measure learning outcomes in a systematic way across countries; but these tests are relatively new, and they tend to cover only specific geographical areas and skills.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>One possible approach to learn from all these overlapping but disparate international and regional tests, is to put them on a consistent scale, and then pool them together across skills to maximize coverage across years and countries. This is exactly what Nadir Altinok, Noam Angrist and Harry Patrinos did in a new working paper: <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/706141516721172989/pdf/WPS8314.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Data Set on Education Quality (1965&#x2013;2015)</a>. They collected data from a large set of psychometrically-robust international and regional student achievement tests available since 1965, and they linked them together in a common measurement system. The four charts above rely on their data.</em></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

One such selection effect is driven by immigration. If a country tends to attract the most able students from around the world, it will have high mean scores. For instance, PISA 2009 results showed that approximately 15 percent of pupils from Singapore have an immigrant background, while this proportion is more than 40 percent in Qatar, which might drive mean scores up due to immigration rather than school quality alone.&#8221;</em></p></li><li id="note-2"><p>That test scores do not perfectly capture skills is probably part of the reason why in many poor countries test scores seem to be very low, yet returns to attending school are very high.</p></li><li id="note-3"><p>This is of course only a correlation. Unfortunately, the evidence on the causal effect of test scores on economic growth is not very strong, but this largely because establishing causality at the macro level is very difficult and we are only starting to get reliable data on aggregate learning outcomes across countries and time. The data we have been discussing here will likely open new possibilities for academic research on this front.</p></li></ol></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></footer></div></div></div></article></main><div id="wpadminbar" style="display:none"><div class="quicklinks" id="wp-toolbar" role="navigation" aria-label="Toolbar"><ul id="wp-admin-bar-root-default" class="ab-top-menu"><li id="wp-admin-bar-site-name" class="menupop"><a class="ab-item" aria-haspopup="true" href="https://owid.cloud/wp/wp-admin">Wordpress</a></li> <li id="wp-admin-bar-edit"><a class="ab-item" href="https://owid.cloud/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=19745&amp;action=edit">Edit Page</a></li></ul></div></div><section class="donate-footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="owid-row flex-align-center"><div class="owid-col owid-col--lg-3 owid-padding-bottom--sm-3"><p>Our World in Data is free and accessible for everyone.</p><p>Help us do this work by making a donation.</p></div><div class="owid-col owid-col--lg-1"><a href="/donate" class="owid-button donate-button" data-track-note="donate-footer"><span class="label">Donate now</span><span class="icon"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="angle-right" class="svg-inline--fa fa-angle-right fa-w-8 " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M224.3 273l-136 136c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.6-22.6c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l96.4-96.4-96.4-96.4c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L54.3 103c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l136 136c9.5 9.4 9.5 24.6.1 34z"></path></svg></span></a></div></div></div></section><footer class="site-footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="owid-row"><div class="owid-col owid-col--lg-1"><ul><li><a href="/about" data-track-note="footer-navigation">About</a></li><li><a href="/about#contact" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/feedback" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Feedback</a></li><li><a href="/jobs" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Jobs</a></li><li><a href="/supporters" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Supporters</a></li><li><a href="/about/how-to-use-our-world-in-data" data-track-note="footer-navigation">How to use</a></li><li><a href="/donate" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Donate</a></li><li><a href="/privacy-policy" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Privacy policy</a></li></ul></div><div class="owid-col owid-col--lg-1"><ul><li><a href="/blog" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Latest publications</a></li><li><a href="/charts" data-track-note="footer-navigation">All charts</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/OurWorldInData" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OurWorldinData" data-track-note="footer-navigation">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/owid" data-track-note="footer-navigation">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed" data-track-note="footer-navigation">RSS Feed</a></li></ul></div><div class="owid-col owid-col--lg-1"><div class="logos"><a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/global-development" class="partner-logo" data-track-note="footer-navigation"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/oms-logo.svg" alt="Oxford Martin School logo"/></a><a href="/owid-at-ycombinator" class="partner-logo" data-track-note="footer-navigation"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/yc-logo.png" alt="Y Combinator logo"/></a></div></div><div class="owid-col flex-2"><div class="legal"><p>License: All of Our World in Data is completely open access and all work is licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons BY license</a>.
