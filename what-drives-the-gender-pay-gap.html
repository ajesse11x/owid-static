<p>Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.</p>
<p>This blog post is closely related to a companion article where we discuss <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/six-facts-pay-gap">definitions and trends in the gender pay gap</a>. It is also related to our articles exploring female labor force participation <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/female-labor-force-participation-key-facts">trends</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/">determinants</a>.</p>

In contrast, the <em>characteristics of the jobs</em> that women tend to do, remain important contributing factors.</li><li>The gender pay gap is not a direct metric of discrimination. However, evidence from different contexts suggests <em>discrimination</em> is indeed important to understand the gender pay gap. Similarly, <em>social norms</em> affecting the gender distribution of labor are important determinants of wage inequality.</li><li>On the other hand, the available evidence suggests differences in psychological attributes and non-cognitive skills are at best modest factors contributing to the gender pay gap.</li></ul></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="block-wrapper" data-reactroot><div data-variation="full-width" class="wp-block-owid-additional-information"><h3 id="all-our-charts-on-why-is-there-a-gender-pay-gap"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="angle-right" class="svg-inline--fa fa-angle-right fa-w-8 " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M224.3 273l-136 136c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.6-22.6c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l96.4-96.4-96.4-96.4c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L54.3 103c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l136 136c9.5 9.4 9.5 24.6.1 34z"/></svg>All our charts on Why is there a gender pay gap?</h3><div style="height:0;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" class="rah-static rah-static--height-zero"><div style="transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;-webkit-transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;opacity:0"><div class="content">

In contrast to this, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, and other factors that matter for the pay gap, then the result is the <em>adjusted</em> pay gap.</p><p>The idea of the adjusted pay gap is to make comparisons within groups of workers with roughly similar jobs, tenure and education. This allows us to tease out the extent to which different factors contribute to observed inequalities.</p><p>The chart here, from Blau and Kahn (2017) shows the evolution of the adjusted and unadjusted gender pay gap in the US.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>More precisely, the chart shows the evolution of female to male wage ratios in three different scenarios: (i) Unadjusted; (ii) Adjusted, controlling for gender differences in human capital, i.e. education and experience; and (iii) Adjusted, controlling for a full range of covariates, including education, experience, job industry and occupation, among others.

This third point follows from the fact that the difference between the blue and red bars was much larger in 1980 than in 2010.</li><li>And fourth, the green bars grew substantially in the 1980s, but stayed fairly constant thereafter. In other words: Most of the convergence in earnings occurred during the 1980s, a decade in which the &#x201C;unexplained&#x201D; gap shrunk substantially.</li></ul></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-739x550.png" alt="Female to male wage ratio 01" class="wp-image-16606" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-739x550.png 739w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-150x112.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-400x298.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-768x572.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="education-and-experience-have-become-much-less-important-in-explaining-gender-differences-in-wages-in-the-us"><a class="deep-link" href="#education-and-experience-have-become-much-less-important-in-explaining-gender-differences-in-wages-in-the-us"></a>Education and experience have become much less important in explaining gender differences in wages in the US</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The chart here shows a breakdown of the adjusted gender pay gaps in the US, factor by factor, in 1980 and 2010.</p><p>When comparing the contributing factors in 1980 and 2010, we see that education and work experience have become much less important in explaining gender differences in wages over time, while occupation and industry have become more important.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>In this chart we can also see that the &#x2018;unexplained&#x2019; residual has gone down.

In other words, women, more than men, are expected to have temporal flexibility in their jobs. Things like shifting hours of work and rearranging shifts to accommodate emergencies at home. And these are jobs with lower earnings per hour, even when the total number of hours worked is the same.</p><p>The importance of job flexibility in this context is very clearly illustrated by the fact that, over the last couple of decades, women in the US increased their participation and remuneration in only some fields. In a recent paper, Goldin and Katz (2016) show that pharmacy became a highly remunerated female-majority profession with a small gender earnings gap in the US, at the same time as pharmacies went through substantial technological changes that made flexible jobs in the field more productive (e.g. computer systems that increased the substitutability among pharmacists).<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>The chart here shows how quickly female wages increased in pharmacy, relative to other professions, over the last few decades in the US.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Female median earnings of full-time, year-round pharmacists relative to other professions, 1970-2010, US &#x2013; Goldin and Katz (2016)<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-750x464.png" alt="Goldin female pharmacy pay" class="wp-image-16163" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-750x464.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-150x93.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-400x248.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-768x475.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay.png 866w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-motherhood-penalty"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-motherhood-penalty"></a><strong>The motherhood penalty</strong></h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Closely related to job flexibility and occupational choice, is the issue of work interruptions due to motherhood.

We explain the decline in annual earnings by women working less when children are young and getting paid less when children are older. We explain the decline in hourly earnings, which is often referred to as the motherhood penalty, by women moving to lower-paid jobs that are closer to home.&#x201D;</p><p>The fact that the motherhood penalty is indeed about &#x2018;motherhood&#x2019; and not &#x2018;parenthood&#x2019;, is supported by further evidence.</p><p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24219#fromrss">A recent study</a>, also from Denmark, tracked men and women over the period 1980-2013, and found that after the first child, women&#x2019;s earnings sharply dropped and never fully recovered. But this was not the case for men with children, nor the case for women without children.</p><p>These patterns are shown in the chart here.

This leads to obvious questions: What determines the systematic gender differences in occupational choice? What makes women seek job flexibility and take a disproportionate amount of unpaid care work?</p><p>One argument usually put forward is that, to the extent that biological differences in preferences and abilities underpin gender roles, they are the main factors explaining the gender pay gap. In their review of the evidence, Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn (2017) show that there is limited empirical support for this argument.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>To be clear, yes, there is evidence supporting the fact that men and women differ in some key attributes that may affect labor market outcomes. For example standardised tests show that there are <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> statistical gender gaps in maths scores&#xA0;in some countries</a>; and experiments show that women <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid more salary negotiations</a>, and they often <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show particular predisposition to accept and receive requests for tasks with low promotion potential</a>. However, these observed differences are far from being biologically fixed &#x2013; &#x2018;gendering&#x2019; begins early in life and the evidence shows that preferences and skills are highly malleable. You can influence tastes, and you can certainly teach people to tolerate risk, to do maths, or to negotiate salaries.</p><p>What&#x2019;s more, independently of where they come from, Blau and Kahn show that these empirically observed differences can typically only account for a modest portion of the gender pay gap.</p><p>In contrast, the evidence does suggest that social norms and culture, which in turn affect preferences, behaviour and incentives to foster specific skills, are key factors in understanding gender differences in labor force participation and wages.

Goldin (1988), for instance, examines past prohibitions against the training and employment of married women in the US. She touches on some well-known restrictions, such as those against the training and employment of women as doctors and lawyers, before focusing on the lesser known but even more impactful <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_bar" target="_blank">&#x2018;marriage bars&#x2019;</a> which arose in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&#xA0;These work prohibitions are important because they applied to teaching and clerical jobs &#x2013; occupations that would become the most commonly held among married women after 1950. Around the time the US entered World War II, it is estimated that 87% of all school boards would not hire a married woman and 70% would not retain an unmarried woman who married.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>The map here highlights that to this day, explicit barriers across the world limit the extent to which women are allowed to do the same jobs as men.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>However, even after explicit barriers are lifted and legal protections put in their place, discrimination and bias can persist in less overt ways. Goldin and Rouse (2000), for example, look at the adoption of &#x201C;blind&#x201D; auditions by orchestras, and show that by using a screen to conceal the identity of a candidate, impartial hiring practices increased the number of women in orchestras by 25% between 1970 and 1996.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p>Many other studies have found similar evidence of bias in different labor market contexts. Biases also operate in other spheres of life with strong knock-on effects on labor market outcomes. For example, at the end of World War II <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/what-percentage-of-the-us-public-approves-of-working-wives">only 18% of people in the US thought that a wife should work if her husband was able to support her</a>.

What else can be done?</p><p>An obvious alternative is fighting discrimination. But the evidence presented above shows that this is not enough. Public policy and management changes on the firm level matter too: Family-friendly labor-market policies may help. For example, maternity leave coverage can contribute by raising women&#x2019;s retention over the period of childbirth, which in turn raises women&#x2019;s wages through the maintenance of work experience and job tenure.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p><p>Similarly, early education and childcare can increase the labor force participation of women &#x2014; and reduce gender pay gaps&#xA0;&#x2014; by alleviating the unpaid care work undertaken by mothers.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>Additionally, the experience of women&#x2019;s historical advance in specific professions (e.g. pharmacists in the US), suggests that the gender pay gap could also be considerably reduced&#xA0;if firms did not have the incentive to disproportionately reward workers who work long hours, and fixed, non-flexible schedules.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p>Changing these incentives is of course difficult because it requires reorganizing the workplace. But it is likely to have a large impact on gender inequality, particularly in countries where other measures are already in place.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>Implementing these strategies can have a positive self-reinforcing effect. For example, family-friendly labor-market policies that lead to higher labor-force attachment and salaries for women, will raise the returns to women&#x2019;s investment in education &#x2013; so women in future generations will be more likely to invest in education, which will also help narrow gender gaps in labor market outcomes down the line.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>Nevertheless, powerful as these strategies may be, they are only part of the solution. Social norms and culture remain at the heart of family choices and the gender distribution of labor. Achieving equality in opportunities requires ensuring that we change the norms and stereotypes that limit the set of choices available both to men and women. It is difficult, but <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the evidence</a> shows that social norms, too, can be changed.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>
