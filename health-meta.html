life. Being free from illness or injury directly affects our capacity to enjoy life.</p><p>In this entry we provide an overview of the available empirical evidence on aggregate health <em>outcomes</em>, focusing on long-run cross-country data from mortality and morbidity tables; and then provide an analysis of available evidence on health <em>determinants</em>, focusing specifically on the returns to macro healthcare investments.</p><p>Life expectancy is the most commonly used measure used to describe a population&#x2019;s health. Historical data shows that global life expectancy has increased drastically over the last couple of centuries, with substantial long-run improvements in all countries around the world. In fact, recent life expectancy gains in developing countries have been particularly important. However, despite recent progress towards long-run cross-country convergence, there are still huge differences that have to be addressed: in several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa the average life expectancy is still less than 60 years, compared to more than 80 years in countries in Europe or in Japan.</p><p>Historical reductions in child mortality and maternal mortality have been crucial to improving life expectancy around the world. But also for these two measures of health we observe large remaining inequalities: low-income countries still have, on average, child mortality rates that are more than ten times higher than those in high-income countries. We show that similarly large gaps remain for other measures of health, including recent burden-of-disease estimates.</p><p>A growing body of empirical research suggests that, at a macro level, health outcomes are highly responsive to healthcare investments. Moreover, as one would expect, the evidence suggests large health returns to healthcare expenditure at low levels of baseline expenditure. This implies that international resources channeled through development assistance for health, if suitably targeted and managed, have the potential of drastically reducing global inequalities in living standards.</p><p><strong><em>This is a &#x2018;meta-entry&#x2019;.

The estimates from the UK &#x2013; the country for which we have the longest time-series &#x2013; show that life expectancy before 1800 was very low, but since then it has increased drastically. We can see that in less than 200 years the UK doubled life expectancy at birth. And the data shows that similarly remarkable improvements also took place in other European countries during the same period.</p><p>The chart also shows large historical changes in life expectancy estimates for other countries. Notice, for example, that a century ago life expectancy in India and&#xA0;South Korea was as low as 23 years &#x2013; and a century later, life expectancy in India almost tripled, and in South Korea almost quadrupled.</p><p>You can switch to the map view in this visualization by clicking on the corresponding tab, in order to compare life expectancy across countries. The map shows that, despite long-run cross-country convergence, there are still huge differences between countries: people in some sub-Saharan African countries have a life expectancy of less than 50 years, compared to 80 years in countries such as Japan.</p><p>The increase in life expectancy happened to a significant extent because of changing mortality patterns at a young age, but this was not the only reason: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-inequality/">life expectancy increased for people at all ages</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="/grapher/life-expectancy" class="grapherPreview">

This measure provides an overview of health outcomes for the average person in a country. In this section we focus on health outcomes specifically for children.</p><p>An analysis of mortality for children provides important information regarding aggregate health in a country, because the first years of life are characterised by important health-related challenges. Consequently, life expectancy increases substantially conditional on surviving the first years of life. Indeed, as we shall show, an important part of the gains in life expectancy at birth are precisely due to large reductions in child mortality.</p><p>Child mortality is usually measured as the probability per 1,000 live births that a newborn baby will die before reaching age five under current age-specific mortality patterns.</p><p><em><strong>Further in-depth information on child mortality, including definitions, data sources, historical trends and much more, can be found in our dedicated entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality">Child Mortality</a>.</strong></em></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-has-cross-country-child-mortality-changed-in-the-long-run"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-has-cross-country-child-mortality-changed-in-the-long-run"></a>How has cross-country child mortality changed in the long-run?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The interactive time-series plot shows how child mortality has changed over the long run. As we can see, child mortality in industrialised countries today is below 5 per 1,000 live births &#x2013; but these low mortality rates are a very recent development. In pre-modern countries child mortality rates were between 300 and 500 per 1,000 live births. In developing countries the health of children is quickly improving &#x2013; but child mortality is still much higher than in developed countries.</p><p>A second interesting feature of the trends depicted in this chart is that there are many sharp &#x2018;spikes&#x2019; in the 19th century. This is partly because the data quality is improving over time, but also because health crises were more frequent in pre-modern times. The decline of crises is an important aspect of improving &#x2018;living standards&#x2019;.

But have these health improvements also materialized for mothers?</p><p>The chart shows long-run maternal mortality estimates for a selection of mainly high income countries. We can see that a hundred years ago, out of 100,000 child birth, between 500 and 1,000 ended with the death of the mother. This means every 100th to 200th birth led to the mother&#x2019;s death. Since <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate">women gave birth much more often than today</a>, the death of the mother was a common tragedy. Today, these countries have maternal mortality rates close to 10 per 100,000 live births.</p><p>The decline of maternal mortality to around 10 per 100,000 births can be attributed to our modern scientific understanding of the causes leading to maternal mortality. In fact, a common reason for mothers to die was puerperal fever (or childbed fever), which was caused by unhygienic conditions leading to infections in the mothers&#x2019; genital tract during childbirth. It was the physician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis">Ignaz Semmelweis</a> who first noticed the link between hygiene and the survival of mothers in the middle of the 19th century, but it was only until the germ theory of disease became known that appropriate practices became widely adopted.</p><p>The same chart also shows that different countries have achieved progress in maternal mortality at different points in time. The decline of maternal mortality in Finland, for example, began in the middle of the 19th century and didn&#x2019;t reach today&#x2019;s low level until more than a century later. Malaysia in contrast achieved this progress in only a few decades.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maternal-mortality?country=FIN+DEU+IRL+JPN+MYS+NLD" class="grapherPreview">

The arrows connect these two observations, thereby showing the change over time of both measures for all countries in the world. As it can be seen, countries with higher expenditure on healthcare per person tend to have a higher life expectancy. And looking at the change over time, we see that as countries spend more on health, life expectancy of the population increases.</p><p>Notice that the relationship in this chart seems to follow a pattern of &#x2018;diminishing returns&#x2019;: the increase in life expectancy associated with an increase in healthcare expenditure decreases as expenditure increases. This means the proportional highest gains are achieved in poor countries with low baseline levels of spending. This pattern is similar to that observed <a href="/life-expectancy/#life-expectancy-and-gdp">between life expectancy and per capita income</a>.</p><p>The countries are color-coded by world region, as per the inserted legends. Many of the green countries (Sub-Saharan Africa) achieved remarkable progress over the last 2 decades: health spending often increased substantially and life expectancy in many African countries increased by more than 10 years. The most extreme case is Rwanda, where life expectancy has increased from 32 to 64 years since 1995 &#x2013; which was one year after the Rwandan genocide. The graph also shows that the African countries that suffered the most under the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids">HIV/AIDS epidemic</a> &#x2013; Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa &#x2013; experienced a decline of life expectancy from which they have not yet recovered.</p><p>The two most populous countries of the world &#x2013; India and China &#x2013; are emphasized by larger arrows. It is interesting to see that in 1995 China achieved already relatively good health outcomes at comparatively low levels of health spending.</p><p>The association between health spending and increasing life expectancy also holds for rich countries in Europe, Asia, and North America in the upper right corner of the chart. The US is an outlier that achieves only a comparatively short life expectancy considering the fact that the country has by far the highest health expenditure of any country in the world.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-vs-healthcare-expenditure?xScale=log&amp;endpointsOnly=1&amp;time=1995..2014" class="grapherPreview">

Global data on health expenditure per capita is available since 1995 and in this chart we show the level of both measures in the first and last year for which data is available. The arrows connect these two observations, thereby showing the change over time for all countries in the world. We can see that child mortality is declining as more money is spent on health.</p><p>Focusing on changes over time, we can see a particularly striking fact: while there is huge inequality in levels &#x2013; child mortality in the best-performing countries is almost 100-times lower than in the worst &#x2013; inequality in trends is surprisingly stable. Specifically, if you look at the paths over time it is surprising how little heterogeneity there is between very different countries in the world. No matter whether it is a rich country in Europe or a much poorer country in Africa, the proportional decline in child mortality associated with a proportional increase in health expenditure is remarkably similar.</p><p>The visualization also shows the very high global inequality in health spending per capita that is still prevalent today. In the Central African Republic only 25 international-$ are spent per capita while on the other end of the distribution, in the US, 9,403 international-$ are spent. The ratio between the two countries is 376; on average Americans spent more on health per day than a person in the Central African Republic spends in an entire year. This is a very large gap, considering that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/#international-gdp-comparisons-market-vs-ppp-exchange-rates">International-$</a> are adjusted for price differences between countries &#x2013; if price differences were not taken into account, and the spending would have been expressed in US-$ by simply using the exchange rate between the different currencies, the difference would be even larger.</p><p>You can also explore this relationship between healthcare spending and child mortality in this <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-vs-health-expenditure">interactive visualization</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-u5mr-with-labels-1-750x525.png" alt="health-exp-vs-u5mr-with-labels" class="wp-image-8300" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-u5mr-with-labels-1-750x525.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-u5mr-with-labels-1-150x105.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-u5mr-with-labels-1-400x280.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-u5mr-with-labels-1-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-u5mr-with-labels-1.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-strong-is-the-link-between-healthcare-expenditure-and-national-income"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-strong-is-the-link-between-healthcare-expenditure-and-national-income"></a>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and national income?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>At a cross-country level, the strongest predictor of healthcare spending is national income (you can find more about measures of national income in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">entry on GDP data</a>). The following visualization presents evidence of this relationship. The correlation is striking: countries with a higher per capita income are much more likely to spend a larger share of their income on healthcare. In a seminal paper, Newhouse (1977)<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> showed that aggregate income explains almost all of the variance in the level of healthcare expenditure (specifically, Newhouse (1977) showed that among a group of 13 developed countries, GDP per capita explained 92 percent of the variance in per capita health expenditure). Other studies have confirmed that this strong positive relationship remains after accounting for additional factors, such as country-specific demographic characteristics.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p> Although in strict sense this result cannot be interpreted causally &#x2013;&#xA0;since countries differ in many unobservable aspects that relate both to income and healthcare spending &#x2013;, more sophisticated econometric models dealing with the issue of &#x2018;omitted variables&#x2019; seem to confirm that the effect of per capita GDP on expenditure is clearly positive and significant (for a technical discussion of this conclusion see Culyer and Newhouse (2000)).<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/healthcare-expenditure-vs-gdp" class="grapherPreview">

The following visualization, from the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/2014-human-development-report.html">Human Development Report (2014)</a>, places the achievements of these countries in perspective. Specifically, the following graph plots healthcare protection coverage for a selection of countries during the period 1920-2010. As we can see, France, Austria and Germany increased healthcare coverage in the years 1920-1960, while Spain, Portugal and Greece did it later, in the years 1960-1980. Interestingly, however, this graph also shows some notable examples of countries that expanded healthcare coverage much later, but much more quickly. In particular, China, Rwanda and Vietnam built health protection systems in the 21st century, almost from scratch, achieving near universal coverage in only a decade. These examples show that healthcare protection can be expanded very quickly, and not only at low baseline levels of coverage.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Evolution of health protection coverage as a percentage of total population, selected countries &#x2013; Figure 4.2 in the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/2014-human-development-report.html">Human Development Report (2014)</a><a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/HDR2014_InsuranceCoverage-750x448.png" alt="HDR(2014)_InsuranceCoverage" class="wp-image-8398" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/HDR2014_InsuranceCoverage-750x448.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/HDR2014_InsuranceCoverage-150x90.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/HDR2014_InsuranceCoverage-400x239.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/HDR2014_InsuranceCoverage-768x459.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/04/HDR2014_InsuranceCoverage.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="has-aggregate-global-expenditure-on-healthcare-increased-in-the-last-couple-of-decades"><a class="deep-link" href="#has-aggregate-global-expenditure-on-healthcare-increased-in-the-last-couple-of-decades"></a>Has aggregate global expenditure on healthcare increased in the last couple of decades?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>In the last two decades total aggregate global expenditure on healthcare has been relatively stable, albeit with a slow steady increase.

This refers to direct outlays made by households, including gratuities and in-kind payments, to healthcare providers. The following visualization presents out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare by country (as percent of total healthcare expenditure). As it can be seen, in high-income countries these outlays tend to account for only a small fraction of expenditure on healthcare (e.g. France, where the share was always below 8% in the entire series 1995-2013); while in low-income countries, they account for the majority of funding (e.g. Afghanistan, where the share of out-of-pocket expenditure reached 87.7% in 2002). Many countries have followed a clear path in the direction of reducing this type of expenditures (particularly in the developing world), yet some countries have moved in the opposite direction (Russia is a notable case in point, with a threefold increase in the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in the last decade).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-out-of-pocket-expenditure-on-healthcare-by-country?tab=map" class="grapherPreview">

The following visualization shows the percentage of individuals in the US without health insurance for the period 1963-2015. As we can see there are two marked changes in the trends separated by a long period of remarkable stability: there is a sharp drop in the number of uninsured in 1965 with the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, then relatively little change for decades, and then another sharp drop in 2012 with the introduction of the ACA. Disaggregated data shows that those states that decided to expand their Medicaid programs saw larger reductions in their uninsured rates from 2013 to 2015, especially when those states had large uninsured populations to start with (see <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2533698">Obama (2016)</a>.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> for further discussion of these figures). While strictly speaking this is only descriptive evidence &#x2013; we cannot know what would have happened to the trends without the introduction of the ACA &#x2013;, it seems reasonable to assume that the observed improvements in healthcare coverage are indeed a consequence of the ACA.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/percentage-of-persons-without-health-insurance-coverage-us" class="grapherPreview">

The following chart from the WHO shows global coverage trends across the key tracer indicators of essential health services from 2000-2015.</p><p>In general, we see an overall increase in global coverage since 2000. However, some health services see a much steeper rise&#x2014;these are often strongly linked to particular funding and resource efforts stemming from large public policies and coordinated civil-society interventions. Global coverage in tracer interventions against HIV, TB and malaria have shown the most significant increase&#x2014;this is a strong reflection of the large increase in resources supplied through <a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Global Fund</a> and the President&#x2019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (<a href="https://www.pepfar.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEPFAR</a>).</p><p>Immunization (DTP3) coverage has also seen a considerable increase since 2000. This rise has been even more significant across particular regions. In Africa, for example, DTP3 coverage has increased by almost 50 percent since 2000&#x2014;again, this is a strong reflection of increased funding in these areas from the global vaccine alliance (<a href="http://www.gavi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAVI</a>), the United Nations agency and additional donor funds.</p><p>Increases in coverage of maternal and child health services have typically been slower than that of HIV, TB, malaria and DTP3, but have still shown a steady increase since 2000. Like DTP3, this level of increase varies substantially by region; the World Bank reports that antenatal care coverage has increased by 30&#x2013;60 percent in regions outside of Europe and the Americas.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Trends in global coverage of tracer indicators of essential health services, 2000&#x2013;2015.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Trends-in-global-healthcare-tracers-1-713x550.jpg" alt="Trends in global healthcare tracers 1" class="wp-image-12134" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Trends-in-global-healthcare-tracers-1-713x550.jpg 713w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Trends-in-global-healthcare-tracers-1-150x116.jpg 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Trends-in-global-healthcare-tracers-1-400x309.jpg 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Trends-in-global-healthcare-tracers-1-768x593.jpg 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Trends-in-global-healthcare-tracers-1.jpg 1007w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Trends-in-global-healthcare-tracers-1.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="medicine-availability-in-developing-countries-remains-a-barrier-to-affordable-medicine-access"><a class="deep-link" href="#medicine-availability-in-developing-countries-remains-a-barrier-to-affordable-medicine-access"></a>Medicine availability in developing countries remains a barrier to affordable medicine access</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>There are several factors necessary in ensuring everyone has access to essential medicines&#x2014;first, they must be available, and secondly they must be affordable.</p><p>In the chart we see levels of medicine availability (from 2001-2007) within the public sector (blue line), and private sector (yellow line) across thirty developing countries. These are shown as the mean availability by region, with minimum and maximum values also shown.</p><p>There are several important trends to highlight. Firstly, medicine availability within the public sector in developing countries is low&#x2014;only 35 percent on average across the 27 countries reported here. Availability within the private sector is consistently higher, however, this is also not guaranteed&#x2014;on average, more than one-third of private providers had adequate access to essential medicines.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>This has important implications for access to essential medicines&#x2014;especially for the poorest. Most health facilities in the public sector offer medicines at low-cost or free of charge, so are essential in healthcare provision for the poor. When medicines are not available in the public sector, individuals must try to access them privately; these are typically more expensive and unaffordable for many. As we discuss in our entry on Financing Healthcare, price-sensitivity is so critical in low-income countries, that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/#how-sensitive-is-healthcare-spending-to-changes-in-prices">small costs for important healthcare products make a vast difference in demand</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Availability of selected medicines in public and private health facilities between 2001 and 2007 (%)<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Medicine-availability-717x550.jpg" alt="Medicine availability" class="wp-image-12136" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Medicine-availability-717x550.jpg 717w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Medicine-availability-150x115.jpg 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Medicine-availability-400x307.jpg 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Medicine-availability-768x589.jpg 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Medicine-availability.jpg 1089w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Medicine-availability.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div></section>

The main idea in such models is that individuals inherit an initial amount of this stock that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. This conceptualization gives rise to a household production function model of consumer behavior that can be employed to account for the gap between health as an output and medical care as one of many inputs into its production.

For example, the use of primary care “gatekeepers” seems to result in lower health expenditure. And lower levels of health expenditure also appear to occur in systems where the patient first pays the provider and then seeks reimbursement, compared to other systems.
