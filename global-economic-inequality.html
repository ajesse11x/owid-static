And they have also changed over time: in some places living conditions changed dramatically, in others more slowly.</p><p>Our individual stories play out amidst these major global changes and inequalities and it is these circumstances that largely determine how healthy, wealthy, and educated each of us will be in our own lives.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Yes, our own hard work and life choices matter. But as we will see in the data, these matter much less than the one big thing over which we have no control: where and when we are born.&#xA0;<span style="font-weight: 400;">This single, utterly random, factor largely determines the conditions in which we live our lives.</span></p><p>Today&#x2019;s global inequality is the consequence of two centuries of unequal progress. Some places have seen dramatic improvements, while others have not. It is on us today to even the odds and give everyone &#x2013; no matter where they are born &#x2013; the chance of a good life. This is not only right, but, as we will see below, is also realistic. Our hope for giving the next generations the chance to live a good life lies in broad development that makes possible for everyone what is only attainable for few today.</p><p>It strikes many people as inherently unfair that some people are able to enjoy healthy, wealthy, happy lives whilst others continue to live in ill-health, poverty and sorrow. For them it is the inequality in the outcomes of people&#x2019;s lives that matters. For others it is the inequality in opportunity &#x2013; the opportunity to achieve good outcomes &#x2013; that is unfair. But the point of this text is to say that these two aspects of inequality are not separable. Tony Atkinson said it very clearly: <em>&#x201C;Inequality of outcome among today&#x2019;s generation is the source of the unfair advantage received by the next generation. If we are concerned about equality of opportunity tomorrow, we need to be concerned about inequality of outcome today.&#x201D;</em><a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-extent-of-global-inequality-it-is-not-who-you-are-but-where-you-are"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-extent-of-global-inequality-it-is-not-who-you-are-but-where-you-are"></a>The extent of global inequality &#x2013; it is not who you are, but where you are</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Today&#x2019;s global inequality of opportunity means that what matters most for your living conditions is the good or bad luck of your place of birth.</p><p>The inequality between countries that I am focusing on in this text is not the only aspect that needs to be considered. Inequalities within countries and societies &#x2013; regional differences, racial differences, gender differences, and inequalities across other dimensions &#x2013; can also be large, and are all beyond any individual&#x2019;s own control and unfair in the same way.</p><p>This visualization shows the inequality in living conditions between the worst and best-off countries in the world today in a number of aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Health:</strong> A child born in one of the countries with the worst health is 60-times more likely to die than a child born in a country with the best health. In several African countries more than one out of ten children born today will die before they are five years old. In the healthiest countries of the world &#x2013; in Europe and East Asia &#x2013; only 1 in 250 children will die before he or she is 5 years old.
<ul>
<li>Here is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-igme?country=CHN+IND+BIH+OWID_WRL">world map</a> showing child mortality rates around the world.</li>
</ul>
</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> In the countries where people have the best access to education &#x2013; in Europe and North America &#x2013; children of school entrance age today can expect 15 to 20 years of formal education. In Australia, which <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/69706">is an outlier</a>, school life expectancy is 22.9 years. Children entering school at the same time in countries with the poorest access to education can only expect 5 years. And additionally, children tend to learn much less in schools in poorer countries, as we <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/edu-quality-key-facts">explained before</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#school-life-expectancy-captures-the-years-of-schooling-children-can-expect">Here</a> is the world map of expected years of schooling.</li>
</ul>
</li><li><strong>Income:</strong> If you look at average incomes and compare the richest country &#x2013; Qatar with a GDP per capita of almost $117,000 &#x2013; to the poorest country in the world &#x2013; the Central African Republic at $661 &#x2013; then you find a 177-fold difference. This is taking into account price differences between countries and therefore expressed in international-$ (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-ppps">here</a> is an explanation). Qatar and other very resource-rich economies might be considered outliers here, suggesting that it is more appropriate to compare countries that are very rich without relying mostly on exports of natural resources. The US has a GDP per capita of int.-$54,225 and Switzerland of 57,410 international-$. This means the Swiss can spend in 1 month what people in the Central African Republic can spend in 7 years.
<ul>
<li>Here is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank">world map</a> of GDP per capita differences.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul><p>The inequality between different places in the world is much larger than the difference you can make on your own.</p><p>When you are born in a poor place where every tenth child dies you will not be able to get the odds of your baby dying down to the average level of countries with the best child health.</p><p>In a place where the average child can only expect 5 years of education it will be immensely harder for a child to obtain the level of education even the <em>average</em> child gets in the best-off places.</p><p>The difference is even starker for incomes. In a place where GDP per capita is less than $1,000 and the majority lives in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty">extreme poverty</a>, the average incomes in a rich country are unattainable. In a text I am publishing soon I will be looking at the research that studies how much the place of birth matters for people&#x2019;s material prosperity: The short answer is that where you live isn&#x2019;t just more important than all your other characteristics, it&#x2019;s more important than everything else <em>put together</em>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Current-global-inequality-in-standard-of-living-800x506.png" alt="Current global inequality in standard of living" class="wp-image-24319" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Current-global-inequality-in-standard-of-living-800x506.png 800w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Current-global-inequality-in-standard-of-living-150x95.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Current-global-inequality-in-standard-of-living-400x253.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Current-global-inequality-in-standard-of-living-768x486.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Current-global-inequality-in-standard-of-living.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="you-cannot-get-healthy-and-wealthy-on-your-own-societies-make-progress-not-individuals"><a class="deep-link" href="#you-cannot-get-healthy-and-wealthy-on-your-own-societies-make-progress-not-individuals"></a>You cannot get healthy and wealthy on your own &#x2013; Societies make progress, not individuals</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>What is true for inequality across countries around the world today, is also true for change over time.

Of all children born that year 42% died in the first five years of their lives. And the average income in Finland was extremely low: GDP per capita was only $827 per year (this is adjusted for price increases to keep the purchasing power comparable to today). And similarly, even basic education <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-years-of-schooling-long-run?tab=chart&amp;country=CAN+DEU+JPN+KOR+GBR+USA">was not available for most</a>.</p><p>A society where almost half of all children died was not unusual: it was <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past">similarly high in humanity&#x2019;s history</a> until just very recently. The dashed purple line in the chart shows that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-global-overview">around the world in 1800</a> a similarly high share of children died before they had their fifth birthday. At that time there was little global inequality; life was <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-globally-since-1770">short everywhere</a> and no matter where a child was born, chances were high that he or she would die soon.</p><p>And just as there was little inequality in mortality and health between different places around the world, there was also little inequality within countries. The health of the entire society was bad. We have data on the mortality of the English aristocracy from 1550 onwards. Aristocrats died just as early as everyone else.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> Their life expectancy was below 40 years too. Before broader social development even the most privileged status within society would not give you the chance for a healthy life. You just cannot be healthy in an unhealthy place.</p><p><strong>Development and global inequality</strong></p><p>After two centuries of slow, but persistent transformation, Finland is today one of the healthiest and wealthiest places in the world. It wasn&#x2019;t smooth progress &#x2013; during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_famine_of_1866%E2%80%9368">Finnish Famine</a> in the 1860s the mortality rate increased to over half &#x2013; but gradually child health improved and today the child mortality rate is 0.23%. Within two centuries, the chances of a Finnish child surviving to the first five years of its life increased from 58% to 99.77%.</p><p>The same is true for income. Back in 1800, global inequality between countries was much lower than it is today. Even in those countries that are today the richest in the world the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#historical-poverty-in-today-s-rich-countries">majority of people lived in extreme poverty</a> until recently. Finland was no exception.</p><p>The red bubbles in the same chart show child mortality and incomes around the world today. It is the same data that we discussed above in the discussion on the extent of global inequality today, but now you see the data for all the world&#x2019;s countries, not just the worst- and best-off.</p><p>Until around 1800, today&#x2019;s best-off places were as poor as today&#x2019;s worst-off places, and child mortality was even worse. All were in the top-left corner of the chart. What created the global inequality we see today were the large cross-country differences in improvements in health and economic growth over the last two centuries. Angus Deaton referred to this as the &#x2018;Great Escape&#x2019;. He wrote <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10054.html">a book</a> about it with this title in which he chronicles how some parts of the world escaped the worst poverty and disease, while others lagged behind.</p><p>Without looking at the data it is not possible to understand just how dramatically the prosperity and health of a society can be transformed. The health and prosperity in the past was so very bad that no one in Finland could have imagined living the life that is today the reality for the average person in Finland.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Child-mortality-vs-GDP-per-capita-incl-Finland-783x550.png" alt="Child mortality vs gdp per capita incl finland" class="wp-image-24318" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Child-mortality-vs-GDP-per-capita-incl-Finland-783x550.png 783w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Child-mortality-vs-GDP-per-capita-incl-Finland-150x105.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Child-mortality-vs-GDP-per-capita-incl-Finland-400x281.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Child-mortality-vs-GDP-per-capita-incl-Finland-768x540.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/08/Child-mortality-vs-GDP-per-capita-incl-Finland.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="development-caused-an-inequality-between-places-and-between-generations"><a class="deep-link" href="#development-caused-an-inequality-between-places-and-between-generations"></a>Development caused an inequality between places and between generations</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Even the countries where health and access to education are worst today have made progress in these dimensions.

Children with a good chance of survival are not just born in the right place, but also at the right time.

We have to end this unfairness so that children with the best living conditions are just as likely to be born in Sub-Saharan Africa as in Europe or North America.</p><p>We know that this is possible. This is what the historical perspective makes clear. Today Finland is in the bottom right corner of the chart above: one of the healthiest and richest places on the planet. Two centuries ago Finland was all the way in the top left: as poor a place as today&#x2019;s poorest countries and with a child mortality rate much worse than any place in the world today.</p><p>The inequality that we see in the world today is the consequence of unequal progress. Our generation has the opportunity &#x2013; and responsibility I believe &#x2013; to allow every part of the world to develop and transform into a place where health, access to education, and prosperity is a reality.</p><p>There is no reason to believe that what was possible for Finland &#x2013; and all other countries in the bottom right which today are much healthier and wealthier than they were two centuries ago &#x2013; should not be possible for the rest of the world. Indeed, as shown by the massive reduction in global child mortality between 1800 and 2017 &#x2013; from a global average of 43% to 3.9%, as indicated by the horizontal dashed lines &#x2013; much of the world is well on its way.</p><p>Both the progress of the past and the huge inequality around the world today show what is possible for the future.

The data was compiled by the economists Branko Milanovic and Christoph Lakner.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p> To see the change over time, select the years just above the distribution.</p><p>The previous visualization, which showed the the change from 1820 to the year 2000 is based on estimates of inflation-adjusted average incomes per country (GDP per capita) and a measure of income inequality within a country only. It gives us a rough idea of how the distribution of incomes changed, but it is not very detailed and not very precise. In contrast to this, the work by Branko Milanovic and Christoph Lakner is based on much more detailed household survey data. This data measures household income at each decile of the income distribution and the two authors used this information to arrive at the global income distribution. The downside of this approach is that we can only go as far back in time as household surveys were conducted.</p><p>The visualization shows the end of the long era in human history in which global inequality was increasing. Starting with industrialization in North-Western Europe, incomes in this part of the world started to increase while material prosperity in the rest of the world remained low. While some countries followed the European industrialization &#x2013; first Northern America, Oceania, and parts of South America and later Japan and East Asia &#x2013; other countries in Asia and Africa remained poor. As a consequence of this, global inequality increased over a long period of time. Only in the period shown in this visualization did this change: With rapid growth in much of Asia in particular, the global distribution of incomes became less unequal. The incomes of the poorer half of the world population rose faster than the incomes of the richer half of the world population.</p><p><small>If you want to use this visualisation for a presentation or for teaching purposes etc. you can download a zip folder with an image file for every year and an animated .gif <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/03/WorldIncomeDistribution1988to2011.zip">here</a>.</small></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Global Income Distribution 1988 to 2011<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></h6><iframe style="border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/WorldIncomeDistribution_LaknerAndMilanovic/WorldIncomeDistribution_LaknerAndMilanovic1988_100.html" width="100%" height="700" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe></div></div><h3 id="the-latest-data-on-global-inequality-and-a-look-into-the-future"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-latest-data-on-global-inequality-and-a-look-into-the-future"></a>The latest data on global inequality and a look into the future</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>This visualization shows how the global income distribution has changed over the decade up to 2013. Tom&#xE1;&#x161; Hellebrandt and Paolo Mauro,&#xA0;the authors of the paper<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> from which this data is taken, confirm the finding that global inequality has declined: the Gini coefficient of global inequality has declined from 68.7 to 64.9.</p><p>The&#xA0;visualisations above show the income distribution on a logarithmic x-axis. This chart in contrast&#xA0;plots incomes on&#xA0;a linear x-axis&#xA0;and thereby&#xA0;emphasizes how very high global inequality still is: The bulk of the world population lives on very low incomes and the income distribution stretches out very far to the higher incomes at the right-hand side of the chart; and incomes over 14,000 international-$ are cut off as they would make this chart with a linear x-axis unreadable.</p><p>A second striking and very positive global development shown in this chart is the rise of the global median income. In 2003 half of the world population lived on less than 1,090 international-$ per year and the other half lived on more than 1,090 international-$. This level of global median income has almost doubled over the last decade and was&#xA0;2,010 international-$ in 2013.</p><p>Finally, the&#xA0;authors&#xA0;also dare to make a projection of&#xA0;what global inequality will look like in 2035. Assuming the growth rates shown in the insert in the top-right corner, the authors project global inequality to decline further and to reach a Gini of 61.3.
