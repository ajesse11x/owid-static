<ul><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness/#how-important-are-social-connections-for-our-health">Social connections matter directly for our happiness and health.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness/#the-importance-of-personal-relations-for-economic-outcomes">Social connections are instrumental to prosperity and material well-being.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness/#causality-and-implications">Despite the clear link between social connections and well-being, more research is needed to understand causal mechanisms and effect sizes. In particular, more research is needed to pin down the effect that loneliness has on life expectancy.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness/#loneliness-solitude-and-social-isolation">Solitary living arrangements are becoming increasingly common around the world, but there is no evidence that self-reported loneliness is increasing over time. This can be explained by the fact that loneliness and aloneness are not the same.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness/#the-rise-of-social-media-platforms">Social media platforms have transformed social connections around the world. </a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/social-connections-and-loneliness/#are-facebook-and-other-social-media-platforms-bad-for-our-well-being">The causal effect that social media has on adolescent well-being is likely negative, but it is also likely heterogeneous across the population, and much smaller than newspaper headlines suggest.</a></li></ul>

The emphasis on painful is there to make a clear distinction between solitude &#x2013; the state of being alone &#x2013; and subjective loneliness, which is the distressing feeling that comes from unmet expectations of the types of interpersonal relationships we wish to have.</p><p>Researchers use several kinds of data to measure solitude and loneliness. The most common source of data are surveys where people are asked about different aspects of their lives, including whether they live alone, how much time they spend with other people in a given window of time (e.g. &#x2018;last week&#x2019;) or specific context (e.g. &#x2018;at social events, clubs or places of worship&#x2019;); and whether they experience feelings of loneliness (e.g. &#x2018;I have no-one with whom I can discuss important matters with&#x2019;). Researchers sometimes study these survey responses separately, but often they also aggregate them in a composite index.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>Surveys <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0898264312460275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirm</a> that people respond differently to questions about subjective loneliness and physical social isolation, which suggests people do understand these as two distinct issues.</p><p>In the chart here I&#x2019;ve put together estimates on self-reported feelings of loneliness from various sources. The fact that we see such high levels of loneliness, with substantial divergence across countries, explains why this is an important and active research area. Indeed, there are literally hundreds of papers that have used survey data to explore the link between loneliness, solitude, and health. Below is an overview of what these studies find.</p><p><strong>The link between loneliness and physical health</strong></p><p>Most papers studying the link between loneliness and health find that both objective solitude (e.g. living alone) and subjective loneliness (e.g. frequent self-reported feelings of loneliness) are correlated with higher morbidity (i.e. illness) and higher mortality (i.e. likelihood of death).</p><p>The relationship between health and loneliness can of course go both ways: lonely people may see their health deteriorate with time; but it may also be the case that people who suffer from poor health end up feeling more lonely later down the line.</p><p>Because of this two-way relationship it&#x2019;s important to go beyond cross-sectional correlations and focus on longitudinal studies &#x2013; these are studies where researchers track the same individuals over time to see if loneliness predicts illness or mortality in the future, after controlling for baseline behaviors and health status.</p><p>The evidence from longitudinal studies shows that people who experience loneliness during a period of their life tend to be more likely to have worse health later down the line. In the Netherlands, for example, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-pdf/146/6/510/455063/146-6-510.pdf" target="_blank">researchers found</a> that self-reported loneliness among adults aged 55-85 predicted mortality several months later, and this was true after controlling for age, sex, chronic diseases, alcohol use, smoking, self-assessed health condition, and functional limitations.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>Most studies focus either on subjective loneliness, or on objective isolation. But some studies try to compare both. In a recent meta-analysis covering 70 longitudinal studies, the authors <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691614568352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write</a>:<em> &#x201C;We found no differences between measures of objective and subjective social isolation. Results remain consistent across gender, length of follow-up, and world region.&#x201D;</em> And in the concluding section they highlight that, in their interpretation of the evidence, <em>&#x201C;the risk associated with social isolation and loneliness is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality&#x201D;</em>; which include smoking and obesity.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p><strong>The link between mental health and subjective well-being</strong></p><p>In another much-cited review of the evidence, Louise Hawkley and John Cacioppo, two leading experts on this topic, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3874845/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concluded</a> that <em>&#x201C;perhaps the most striking finding in this literature is the breadth of emotional and cognitive processes and outcomes that seem susceptible to the influence of loneliness&#x201D;.</em><a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Researchers have found that loneliness correlates with subsequent increases in symptoms related to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/dementia-death-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dementia</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#depression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">depression</a>, and many other issues related to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental health</a>; and this holds after controlling for demographic variables, objective social isolation, stress, and baseline levels of cognitive function.</p><p>There is also research that suggests a link between loneliness and lower <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction" target="_blank">happiness</a>, and we discuss this in more detail <a href="http://www.ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-friends">here</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/self-reported-loneliness-older-adults" class="grapherPreview">

Humans and rats are of course very different; but experts, such as Hawkley and Cacioppo, argue that these experiments are important because they tell us something meaningful about a shared biological mechanism. In a review of the evidence, Susan Pinker writes: &#x201C;If our big brains evolved to interact, loneliness would be an early warning system&#x2014;a built-in alarm that sent a biological signal to members who had somehow become separated from the group&#x201D;.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Indeed, there&#x2019;s evidence of social regulation of gene expression in humans: <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/7/3080.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies suggest</a> perceived loneliness can switch on/off genes that regulate our immune systems, and it is this what then affects the health of humans, or other animals that evolved with similar defence mechanisms.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="causality-and-implications"><a class="deep-link" href="#causality-and-implications"></a>Causality and implications</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The bulk of evidence from observational studies and biological mechanisms, described above, implies that loneliness most likely matters for our health and well being.

Even the studies linking loneliness and genetics can be subject to this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mru.org/dictionary-economics/omitted-variable-economics" target="_blank">omitted-variable bias</a>, because a genetic predisposition to loneliness may drive both loneliness and health outcomes.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>I could not find credible experimental evidence that would allow us to have a precise estimate of the magnitude of the causal effect.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> But the fact that we struggle to pin down the magnitude of the effect doesn&#x2019;t mean we should dismiss the available evidence.

The idea was to track the development of a group of teenage boys through periodic interviews and medical checkups, with the aim of understanding how their health and well-being evolved as they grew up.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>Today, more than 80 years later, it is one of the longest running research programmes in social science.

The program started with 724 boys, and researchers continue to monitor today the health and well-being of those initial participants who are still alive, most in their late 90s.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>This is a unique scientific exercise &#x2013; most longitudinal studies do not last this long because too many participants drop out, researchers move on to other projects (or even die), or the funding dries up.</p><p>So what have we learned from this unique study?</p><p>Robert Waldinger, the current director of the study, summarized &#x2013; in what is now one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/8KkKuTCFvzI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most viewed TED Talks to date</a> &#x2013; the findings from decades of research. The main result, he concluded, is that social connections are one of the most important factors for people&#x2019;s <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">happiness</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health</a>. He said: &#x201C;Those who kept warm relationships got to live longer and happier, and the loners often died earlier&#x201D;.</p><p>Here I take a closer look at the evidence and show more research that finds a consistent link between social connections and happiness. But before we get to the details, let me explain why I think this link is important.</p><p>As most people can attest from personal experience, striving for happiness is not easy. In fact, the search for happiness can become a source of <em>unhappiness</em> &#x2013; there are studies that show actively pursuing happiness <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eerlab/pdf/papers/Ford_Mauss_Pursuit_of_Positive_Emotion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can end up decreasing it</a>.</p><p>The data shows that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#income" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">income and happiness are clearly related</a>; but we also know from surveys that people often <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/spc3.12386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overestimate the impact of income on happiness</a>. Social relations might be the missing link: In rich countries, where minimum material living conditions are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#historical-poverty-in-today-s-rich-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often satisfied</a>, people may struggle to become happier because they are targeting material rather than social goals.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-cross-sectional-correlation-between-happiness-and-friends"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-cross-sectional-correlation-between-happiness-and-friends"></a>The cross-sectional correlation between happiness and friends</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The <a href="http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Value Survey (WVS)</a> is a large cross-country research project that collects data from a series of representative national surveys. In the fourth wave (1999-2004) the WVS asked respondents hundreds of questions about their lives, including whether they were part of social or religious groups, how often they spent time with friends, and whether they felt happy with their life.</p><p>By comparing self-reported happiness among those with and without frequent social interactions, we can get an idea of whether there is indeed a raw correlation between happiness and social relations across different societies.</p><p>In the chart below I show this comparison: The green points correspond to happiness among those who interact with friends at least once per month; while the blue dots correspond to happiness among those who interact with friends less often.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p>This chart shows that in almost all countries people who often spend time with their friends report to be happier than those who spend less time with friends.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/07/happiness-and-friends-v3-e1564090552891.png" alt="Happiness and friends v3 e1564090552891" class="wp-image-23997" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/07/happiness-and-friends-v3-e1564090552891.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-link-between-social-relations-and-happiness-over-time"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-link-between-social-relations-and-happiness-over-time"></a>The link between social relations and happiness over time</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The chart above gives a cross-sectional perspective &#x2013; it&#x2019;s just a snapshot that compares different people at a given point in time. What happens if we look at changes in social relations and happiness over time?</p><p>There is a large academic literature in medicine and psychology that shows individuals who report feelings of loneliness are more likely to have health problems later in life (you can read more about this in my post <a href="http://www.ourworldindata.org/social-relations-health-and-well-being" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>); and similarly, there are also many studies that show that changes in social relations predict changes in happiness and life satisfaction.</p><p>One of the research papers that draws on data from the famous Harvard Study of Adult Development, for example, looked at the experiences of 82 married participants and their spouses, and found that greater self-reported couple attachment predicted lower levels of depression and greater life satisfaction 2.5 years later.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p><p> Other studies with larger population samples have also found a similar cross-temporal link: perceived social isolation predicts subsequent changes in depressive symptoms but not vice versa, and this holds after controlling for demographic variables and stress.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>Searching for happiness is typically an intentional and active pursuit. Is it the case that people tend to become happier when they purposely decide to improve their social relations?</p><p>This is a tough empirical question to test; but <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797618761660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent study</a> found evidence pointing in this direction.</p><p>Using a large representative survey in Germany, researchers asked participants to report, in text format, ideas for how they could improve their life satisfaction. Based on these answers, the researchers then investigated which types of ideas predicted changes in life satisfaction one year later.</p><p>The researchers found that those who reported socially-engaged strategies (e.g. &#x201C;I plan to spend more time with friends and family&#x201D;) often reported improvements in life satisfaction one year later; while those who described other non-social active pursuits (e.g. &#x201C;I plan to find a better job&#x201D;) did not report increased life satisfaction.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="social-connections-are-we-happier-when-we-spend-more-time-with-others"><a class="deep-link" href="#social-connections-are-we-happier-when-we-spend-more-time-with-others"></a>Are we happier when we spend more time with others?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>From decades of research we know that social relations predict mental well-being over time; and from a recent study we also know that people who actively decide to improve their social relations often report becoming happier. So yes, people are happier when they spend more time with friends.</p><p>Does this mean that if we have an exogenous shock to our social relations this will have a permanent negative effect on our happiness?</p><p>We can&#x2019;t really answer this with the available evidence. More research is needed to really understand the causal mechanisms that drive the link between happiness and social relations.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>Despite this, however, I think that we should take the available observational evidence seriously. In a way, the causal impact from a random shock is less interesting than the evidence from active strategies that people might take to improve their happiness. People who get divorced, for example, often report a short-term drop in life satisfaction; but over time they tend to recover and eventually end up being more satisfied with their life than shortly before they divorced (you can read more about this in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#life-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entry on happiness and life satisfaction</a>).</p><p>It makes sense to consider the possibility that healthy social relationships are a key missing piece for human wellbeing. Among other things, this would help explain the paradoxical result from studies where actively pursuing happiness <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eerlab/pdf/papers/Ford_Mauss_Pursuit_of_Positive_Emotion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apparently ends up decreasing it</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="the-importance-of-social-networks-for-innovation-and-productivity"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-importance-of-social-networks-for-innovation-and-productivity"></a>The importance of social networks for innovation and productivity</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Economies today are increasingly built on ideas.

Knowledge is different from many physical assets, in that it can be used by many people at the same time; so the diffusion of knowledge creates productivity gains that spillover through society. As Thomas Jefferson once said: <em>&#x201C;He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me&#x201D;.</em><a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></p><p>What is the empirical value of this theory? What do &#x2018;knowledge spillovers&#x2019; actually look like in the real world? Do scientists and engineers really rely on social connections to disseminate their new ideas and inventions?</p><p>To answer these questions economists have looked into historical data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/patent-applications-per-million">patents</a>.&#xA0;</p><p>Patents are government licences used to register the intellectual property of new inventions, ranging <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/patents-usa-by-category">from machines to medical drugs</a>. When a patent application is filed, inventors are required to include a list of citations, in which they describe how their technological development builds upon the results of earlier patents. These historical records of patent citations give us an overview of how knowledge flows &#x2013; patent citations are the &#x2018;paper trail&#x2019; left by ideas as they travel, evolve, and make new ideas possible.</p><p>One of the first analyses of patent citations in the context of knowledge spillovers was done by Adam Jaffe, Manuel Trajtenberg and Rebecca Henderson, in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/108/3/577/1881813">a much-cited paper</a> published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1993.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p><p>Jaffe and coauthors studied, in particular, the geographic distribution of citation patterns in the US.&#xA0;</p><p>If social connections did not matter for new ideas and growth, then we should expect that new inventions are just as likely to cite patents from far away as they are to cite the work of their neighbours. In contrast, Jaffe and coauthors found that new patents were disproportionately more likely to cite previous <em>local</em> patents. In other words, they found that patent citations were strongly geographically concentrated. According to their estimates, citations were three to four times as likely to come from the same state as the originating patent &#x2013; this is consistent with the idea that social connections and proximity do indeed matter for innovation.</p><p>After this initial study, several other papers have used patent citations to explore the determinants of knowledge spillovers, with a broader perspective on &#x2018;proximity&#x2019;.&#xA0;</p><p>Ajay Agrawal, Devesh Kapur and John McHale used the ethnicity of researchers as a proxy for social connectedness, and <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.515.3876&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">found</a> that co-location and co-ethnicity both increase the probability of knowledge flow between inventors. Co-location increases the probability of a knowledge flow by 24% (assuming non-co-ethnic inventors) and co-ethnicity increases the probability by 14% (assuming non-co-located inventors). Again, these large concentration patterns seem consistent with the idea that proximity and social networks matter for innovation.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="disentangling-geographic-proximity-and-social-interactions"><a class="deep-link" href="#disentangling-geographic-proximity-and-social-interactions"></a>Disentangling geographic proximity and social interactions</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The correlation between proximity and patent citations partly captures the effect that local factors may have on innovation (e.g. geography, regulation or infrastructure around industry hubs where similar workers and firms concentrate). However, the evidence shows that social connections matter for the transmission of knowledge even after we control for these other factors.</p><p>In <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.32.3.259">a paper</a> published in 2018 in the <em>Journal of Economic Perspectives</em>, Michael Bailey, Rachel Cao, Theresa Kuchler, Johannes Stroebel, and Arlene Wong combined patent records with Facebook data from the US, and found that social connectedness between US counties (measured by the frequency of Facebook ties between counties) predicts the probability of cross-county patent citations.

<p>Social networks are diverse and complex, so talking about &#x201C;social connectedness&#x201D; is actually a simplification that deserves some discussion. Researchers studying social networks have shown that the flow of information and knowledge through people is not only a function of &#x201C;connectedness&#x201D; as measured by the number of links people have, but also a function of the specific structures of the networks (e.g. the extent to which social ties are tightly clustered). </p>



<p>For the diffusion of information, the concept of &#x2018;homophily&#x2019;, for example, is key. <br>Homophily is the tendency of agents to associate with other agents who have similar characteristics. This manifests itself in many ways &#x2013; for example, in the fact that friendship ties are typically strongly related to ethnicity.  If one is interested in how information spreads through social learning, patterns such as homophily or social segregation are important to understand.  For example, in the labor market, homophily isolates workers of one ethnicity from workers of another ethnicity, which then limits the extent to which individuals in one group hear about openings and opportunities known to the other group.<br>Social networks research in this area shows that, in general, as homophily increases, the propensity for a diffusion to gain hold within a particular group rises, sometimes at the expense of the speed and extent of diffusion throughout the entire population. </p>



<p>Similarly, diversity may play a role. Observational studies <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5981/1029">show</a> that the diversity of individuals&#x2019; relationships is strongly correlated with the economic development of communities.<br>You can read more about this in Jackson, M. O., Rogers, B. W., &amp; Zenou, Y. (2017). The economic consequences of social-network structure. Journal of Economic Literature, 55(1), 49-95.

Having personal relationships with East Germans gave them access to valuable economic information &#x2013; information regarding local demand conditions, and about the quality of East German assets that were offered to investors.</p><p>These gains from social connections actually added up at the regional level. West German regions that had a higher concentration of households with social ties to the East, enjoyed substantially higher growth in incomes in the early 1990s.

Perhaps the best example is job searching: personal contacts and connections are one of the most common ways for people to find a job.</p><p>In the book <em>The Human Network</em>, the economist Matthew Jackson draws on decades of research to help explain how social connections affect power, beliefs and behaviors. With regard to job networks and social capital, he writes: &#x201C;<em>If you have ever struggled to find a job, you are not alone.

This is what many people have in mind when they think about job referrals. If there is only one job vacancy, giving the job to a friend means not giving the job to someone else. If social connections become a vehicle for favouritism, this can lead to inefficiencies.</p><p>In many contexts, however, the opposite is true. Social connections often have a net-positive effect on aggregate economic outcomes because much of the impact of social connections on economic transactions is not zero-sum &#x2013; for example, when social connections reduce information frictions and allow people to learn from each other.

As a consequence property prices there fell relative to the new economic areas that emerged further away from the Wall.&#xA0;</p><p>When the Wall came down the distribution of economic activity within the city changed quickly once again: The old business district began to re-emerge and economic activity shifted back to the historic center.

This is not only happening in the US: single-person households have become increasingly common in many countries across the world, from Angola to Japan.</p><p>Historical records show that this &#x2018;rise of living alone&#x2019; started in early-industrialized countries over a century ago, accelerating around 1950. In countries such as Norway and Sweden, single-person households were rare a century ago, but today they account for nearly half of all households.

This reveals that the rise of single-person households tends to be larger in countries where GDP per capita has grown more. <em>(NB. You can also see the correlation over time in </em><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/one-person-households-vs-gdp-per-capita?stackMode=relative&amp;time=1990..2016"><em>this other</em></a><em> scatter plot comparing average growth in GDP vs average growth in one-person households).</em></p><p>These correlations are partly due to the fact that people who can afford to, often choose to live alone. Indeed, rising incomes in many countries are likely part of the reason why people are more likely to live alone today than in the past.&#xA0;</p><p>But there must be more to it since even at the same level of incomes there are clear differences between regions. In particular, Asian countries have systematically fewer one-person households than African countries with comparable GDP levels. Ghana and Pakistan, for example, have similar GDP per capita, but in Pakistan one-person households are extremely rare, while in Ghana they are common (about 1 in 4). This suggests culture and country-specific factors also play an important role.</p><p>Additionally, there are other non-cultural country-specific factors that are likely to play a role. In particular, rich countries often have more extensive social support networks, so people in these countries find it easier to take risks. Living alone is more risky in poorer countries, because there&#x2019;s often less supply of services and infrastructure to support more solitary living arrangements.&#xA0;</p><p>And finally, it&#x2019;s also likely that some of the causality runs in the opposite direction. It&#x2019;s not only that incomes, culture or welfare states enable people to live alone, but also that for many workers attaining higher incomes in today&#x2019;s economy often demands changes in living arrangements.

This begs two questions: (i) Is it true that younger people are lonelier, and (ii) does this show that loneliness is increasing?</p><p>Let&#x2019;s start with the first question. In England, the Office for National Statistics conducts the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/community-life-survey-2018-19">Community Life Survey</a>, in which they ask people how often they feel lonely. In the bar chart here we show a breakdown of self-reported loneliness by age group.</p><p>According to this data, those aged 16 to 24 are the group most likely to report feeling lonely, with 10% feeling lonely &#x201C;often or always&#x201D;. In contrast, those aged 65 years and older are the group least likely to report feeling lonely, with 3% feeling lonely &#x201C;often or always&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p><p>Many people tend to associate loneliness with older age, so this pattern might seem surprising. But surveys from several other rich countries have found the same. In <a href="http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/people_and_communities/older_people/loneliness-in-nz-2010-NZGSS/loneliness-in-nz.aspx">New Zealand</a>, <a href="http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Loneliness-and-Social-Isolation-in-the-United-States-the-United-Kingdom-and-Japan-An-International-Survey">Japan</a> and the <a href="https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/docs/IndexReport_1524069371598-173525450.pdf">US</a>, young adults also report feeling lonely more often than older adults.</p><p>So, yes, in rich countries we find that younger people are more likely to report feeling lonely.<a id="ref-36" class="ref" href="#note-36"><sup>36</sup></a></p><p>What about the second question? Does this mean that loneliness is increasing?&#xA0;</p><p>Here, the answer is &#x2018;no&#x2019;. Cross-sectional comparisons are not informative about changes <em>over time</em>, because loneliness is not constant across the life cycle. To be able to say something meaningful about changes in loneliness over time, we need to distinguish between changes for <em>individuals</em> over time (do people become lonelier as they get older?) and changes across generations (are people of the same age lonelier today than in the past?).</p><p>Let&#x2019;s dig deeper and explore these questions separately.&#xA0;</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Reported-loneliness-by-age-in-England-731x550.png" alt="Reported loneliness by age in england" class="wp-image-29000" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Reported-loneliness-by-age-in-England-731x550.png 731w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Reported-loneliness-by-age-in-England-400x301.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Reported-loneliness-by-age-in-England-150x113.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Reported-loneliness-by-age-in-England-768x578.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Reported-loneliness-by-age-in-England-1536x1156.png 1536w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Reported-loneliness-by-age-in-England-2048x1541.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/Reported-loneliness-by-age-in-England.png"></figure></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="do-we-become-lonelier-as-we-get-older"><a class="deep-link" href="#do-we-become-lonelier-as-we-get-older"></a>Do we become lonelier as we get older?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>To understand how loneliness changes across our life cycle, we need loneliness data from surveys that track the same individuals over time, up until old age.

When adjusting for these factors, they found that loneliness continued declining into &#x2018;oldest old age&#x2019;.</p><p>This shows that there are two forces at play. On the one hand, there seems to be a direct relationship between age and loneliness, whereby loneliness <em>decreases</em> with age as our social expectations adapt, and we become <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/S15324834BASP2304_2?casa_token=885gubc-kPAAAAAA:gP8oVDQ-085Ftuh1-pvmG4Ms4-O58KDka4hjgK5Nq7RjS3ZsESymhhPo_owFbaf5MufXSx2LvFc0oA">more selective</a> about relating with contacts who bring positive emotions.

This is based on the idea that there have been societal changes &#x2013; such as the <a href="http://www.ourworldindata.org/living-alone">rise of living alone</a> &#x2013; that make newer generations more likely to feel lonely.</p><p>In their <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/vx9nh/download">study</a>, Louise Hawkley and co-authors searched for evidence of these &#x2018;cohort trends&#x2019; in the US, but didn&#x2019;t find any. There was very little difference in self-reported loneliness of people born in different generations. Those that were born in 1920-1947 experienced the same changes of loneliness throughout their lives as those born in 1948-1965. It&#x2019;s not the case that loneliness is increasing across generations.</p><p>An <a href="https://unherd.com/2019/05/is-the-epidemic-of-loneliness-fake-news/">article</a> by Tom Chievers explains this result from the study very well: <em>&#x201C;[Hawkley and co-authors] found that &#x201C;newer&#x201D; old people (baby boomers born 1948-1965) are no more likely to think of themselves as lonely than &#x201C;older&#x201D; old people (born 1920-1947), and that older people have not become more likely to think of themselves as lonely in the last decade (2005 &#x2013; 2016)&#x2026; The average older person appears to be no more likely to be lonely than they were a decade ago.&#x201D;</em></p><p>There are studies with data from other rich countries pointing in the same direction. In Sweden, repeated cross-sectional surveys with adults aged 85, 90, and 95 years old, found no increase in loneliness over a ten-year interval.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a></p><p>These studies find no evidence of cohort effects across older adults.

Other social media platforms including Youtube and Whatsapp also have more than one billion users each.&#xA0;</p><p>These numbers are huge &#x2013; there are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">7.7 billion people</a> in the world, with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-internet-users-by-country?tab=chart&amp;time=1990..2016&amp;country=OWID_WRL">3.5 billion of us online</a>. This means social media platforms are used by one-in-three people in the world, and more than two-thirds of all internet users.&#xA0;</p><p>Social media has changed the world. The rapid and vast adoption of these technologies is changing how we <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/36/17753">find partners</a>, how we <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/10/social-media-outpaces-print-newspapers-in-the-u-s-as-a-news-source/">access information from the news</a>, and how we <a href="https://www.twitterandteargas.org/">organize to demand political change</a>.&#xA0;</p><p>Who uses social media? When did the rise of social media start and what are the largest sites today? Here we answer these and other key questions to understand social media use around the world.&#xA0;</p><p>We begin with an outline of key trends and conclude with a perspective on the rate of adoption of social media relative to other modern communication technologies.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="social-media-started-in-the-early-2000s"><a class="deep-link" href="#social-media-started-in-the-early-2000s"></a>Social media started in the early 2000s</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>The first social media site to reach a million monthly active users was MySpace &#x2013;&#xA0;it achieved this milestone around 2004. This is arguably the beginning of social media as we know it.<a id="ref-41" class="ref" href="#note-41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>



<p>In the interactive chart we plot monthly active users, by platform, since 2004. You can use the slider to focus on particular years, and you can click the &#x2018;+ Add&#x2019; option to change series and track the evolution of other social media platforms.</p>



<p>This chart shows that there are some large social media sites that have been around for ten or more years, such as Facebook, YouTube and Reddit; but other large sites are much newer.&#xA0;</p>



<p>TikTok, for example, launched in September 2016 and by mid-2018 it had already reached half a billion users. To put this in perspective: TikTok gained on average about 20 million new users per month over this period.</p>



<p>The data also shows rapid changes in the opposite direction. Once-dominant platforms have disappeared. In 2008, Hi5, MySpace and Friendster were close competitors to Facebook, yet by 2012 they had virtually no share of the market. The case of MySpace is remarkable considering that in 2006 it <a href="https://mashable.com/2006/07/11/myspace-americas-number-one/">temporarily surpassed Google</a> as the most visited website in the US.</p>



<p>Most of the social media platforms that survived the last decade have shifted significantly in what they offer users. Twitter, for example, didn&#x2019;t allow users to upload videos or images in the beginning. Since 2011 this is possible and today <a href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/78">more than 50%</a> of the content viewed on Twitter includes images and videos.</p>

<p>The aggregate numbers mask a great deal of heterogeneity across platforms &#x2013; some social media sites are much more popular than others among specific population groups.&#xA0;</p>



<p>In general, young people are more likely to use social media than older people. But some platforms are much more popular among younger people. This is shown in this chart, where we plot the breakdown of social media use by age groups in the US.</p>



<p>For Snapchat and Instagram the &#x2018;age gradient&#x2019; is extremely steep &#x2013; the popularity of these platforms drops much faster with age. The majority of people under 25 use Snapchat (73%), while only 3% of people over 65 use it.</p>



<p>Since these platforms are relatively new, it&#x2019;s hard to know how much of this age gradient is the result of a &#x201C;cohort effect&#x201D;. In other words: it&#x2019;s unclear whether today&#x2019;s young people will continue using Snapchat as they become older. If they do, the age gradient would narrow.</p>

<p>From a back-of-the-envelope calculation we know that, if Facebook has 2.3 billion users, then at least 30% of the world uses social media.<a id="ref-42" class="ref" href="#note-42"><sup>42</sup></a> This is of course just an average &#x2013; for some world regions, and specifically for some population groups, usage rates are much higher.</p>



<p>Young people tend to use social media more frequently. In fact, in rich countries, where access to the internet is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-individuals-using-the-internet">nearly universal</a>, the vast majority of young adults use it.&#xA0;</p>



<p>The chart here shows the proportion of people aged 16 to 24 who use social networks across a selection of countries. As we can see, the average for the OECD is close to 90%.</p>



<p>If today&#x2019;s young adults continue using social media throughout their life, then it&#x2019;s likely that social media will continue growing rapidly as internet adoption <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet#growth-of-the-internet">expands throughout lower-income countries</a>.</p>

<p>In the US, adults spend more than 6 hours per day on digital media (apps and websites accessed through mobile phones, tablets, computers and other connected devices such as game consoles).

<p>The percentage of US adults who use social media increased from 5% in 2005 to 79% in 2019. Even on a global stage the speed of diffusion is striking: Facebook surged from covering around 1.5% of the world population in 2008, to around 30% in 2018.<a id="ref-45" class="ref" href="#note-45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>



<p>How does this compare to the diffusion of other communication technologies that make part of our everyday life today?</p>



<p>The following chart provides some perspective.</p>



<p>Social media&#x2019;s growth in the US is comparable &#x2013; in speed and to some extent also in reach &#x2013; to that of most modern communication-enabling technologies, including computers, smartphones and the internet.&#xA0;</p>



<p>The rise of social media is an extraordinary example of how quickly and drastically social behaviours can change: Something that is today part of the everyday life of one-third of the world population, was unthinkable less than a generation ago.</p>



<p>Fast changes like those brought about by social media always spark fears about possible negative effects. Specifically in the context of social media, a key question is whether these new communication technologies are having a negative impact on our mental health &#x2013; this is an important question and we cover the evidence at Our World in Data <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/social-media-wellbeing">here</a>.&#xA0;</p>

Or put differently, using social media more heavily is correlated with less satisfaction.</p><p>This is certainly interesting, but we should be careful not to jump to conclusions &#x2013; the correlation actually raises as many questions as it answers.<a id="ref-46" class="ref" href="#note-46"><sup>46</sup></a></p><p>Does this pattern hold if we control for user characteristics like age and gender? Would we get similar results if we focused on other measures of well-being beyond &#x2018;happy with time spent&#x2019;?</p><p>The answer to both questions is &#x2018;no&#x2019;. Depending on what outcome variables you focus on, and depending on which demographic characteristics you account for, you will get a different result. It is therefore not surprising that some empirical academic studies have found negative correlations; while others actually report positive correlations.<a id="ref-47" class="ref" href="#note-47"><sup>47</sup></a> </p><p>Amy Orben and Andrew Przybylski <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0506-1">published a paper</a> earlier this year in the journal <em>Nature</em> where they illustrated that given the flexibility to analyze the data (i.e. given the number of possible choices researchers have when it comes to processing and interpreting the vast data from these large surveys), scientists <a href="https://socialsciences.nature.com/users/200472-amy-orben/posts/42763-beyond-cherry-picking">could have written thousands of papers</a> describing positive, negative and non-significant associations.

It used data from a survey that tracked a group of 5,208 Americans over the period 2013 &#x2013; 2015, and found an increase in Facebook activity was associated with a future <em>decrease</em> in reported mental health.<a id="ref-49" class="ref" href="#note-49"><sup>49</sup></a></p><p>Two years later, Amy Orben, Tobias Dienlin and Andrew Przybylski <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/21/10226.full.pdf">published a paper</a> in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> using a similar source of data. They relied on a longitudinal survey from the UK covering 12,672 teenagers over the period 2009 &#x2013; 2016, and reached a different conclusion. They found that there was a small and reciprocal relationship: social media use predicted small decreases in life satisfaction; but it was also the case that decreasing life satisfaction predicted subsequent increases in social media use.<a id="ref-50" class="ref" href="#note-50"><sup>50</sup></a></p><p>Summarizing their research in <em>The Guardian</em>, Amy Orben and Andrew Przybylski <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/07/too-much-screen-time-hurts-kids-where-is-evidence">explained</a>: <em>&#x201C;we did find some small trends over time &#x2013; these were mostly clustered in data provided by teenage girls&#x2026; But &#x2013; and this is key &#x2013; it&#x2019;s not an exaggeration to say that these effects were minuscule by the standards of science and trivial if you want to inform personal parenting decisions.

Long-run surveys that track people are expensive and impose a high burden on participants, so they do not allow in-depth high-frequency data collection, and instead focus on broad trends across a wide range of topics. Orben and co-authors, for example, rely on the <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/"><em>Understanding Society Survey</em></a> from the UK, which covers a wide range of themes such as family life, education, employment, finance, health and wellbeing. Specifically on social media use, this survey only ask how many hours teenagers remember using apps during normal weekdays, which is of course an informative but noisy measure of actual use (a fact that Orben and co-authors mention in their paper).</p><p>Second, there are limitations from unobservable variables. Frequent users of social media are likely different from less frequent users in ways that are hard to measure &#x2013; no matter how many questions you include in a survey, there will always be relevant factors you cannot account for in the analysis.</p><p>Given these limitations, an obvious alternative is to run an experiment: you can, for example, offer people money to stop using Facebook for a while and then check the effect by comparing these &#x201C;treated participants&#x201D; against a control group that is allowed to continue using Facebook as usual.<a id="ref-53" class="ref" href="#note-53"><sup>53</sup></a></p><p>Several recent papers followed this approach. Here I&#x2019;ll discuss <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25514.pdf">one of them in particular</a>, because I find its approach particularly compelling. The analysis relies on a much larger sample than other experiments, and the researchers registered a <a href="https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3409">pre-analysis plan</a> to insure themselves against the &#x2018;analytical flexibility&#x2019; criticisms discussed above.<a id="ref-54" class="ref" href="#note-54"><sup>54</sup></a></p><p>This experiment was done by four economists: Hunt Allcott, Sarah Eichmeyer, Luca Braghieri and Matthew Gentzkow.

A careful analysis of survey data reveals that, yes, there is a correlation between social media and well-being; but the relationship works both ways. This becomes clear from the longitudinal studies: Higher use of social media predicts decreases in life satisfaction; and decreasing life satisfaction also predicts subsequent increases in social media use.</p><p>The second takeaway is that the causal effect of social media on well-being is likely small for the average person. The best empirical evidence suggests the impact is much smaller than many news stories suggest and most people believe.</p><p>There is much to be learned about how to make better use of these digital platforms, and there is an important discussion to be had about the opportunity costs of spending a large fraction of our time online. But for this we need to look beyond the sweeping newspaper headlines.</p><p>We need research with more granular data to unpack diverse use patterns, to understand the different effects that certain types of content have on specific population groups. Time alone is a poor metric to gauge effects. As Andrew Przybylski put it: nobody would argue we should study the causes of obesity by investigating &#x2018;food time&#x2019;.</p><p>Going forward, the conversation in policy and the news should be much more about strategies to promote positive content and interactions, than about one-size-fits-all restrictions on social media &#x2018;screen time&#x2019;.<br></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

From what I gather, all the articles that cite this figure trace back to Dr. Vivek Murthy and a meta-analysis by Holt-Lunstad et al. (2015), which I discuss in more detail below in this post. When I reviewed this meta-analysis I did find the claim that loneliness is a risk factor comparable to smoking; but I could not find the calculations that lead to the 15 cigarettes benchmark. It’s still unclear to me what the unit of loneliness is and what this translates into in terms of years of lives lost. However, given that 15 cigarettes per day is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/consumption-per-smoker-per-day-bounds" target="_blank">about average consumption among smokers</a>, it’s possible that the benchmark comes from comparing excess mortality of smoking for the average smoker, vs. excess mortality of loneliness for average levels of loneliness.</p></li><li id="note-2"><p>The most popular composite index is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Loneliness_Scale" target="_blank">UCLA Loneliness Scale</a>, which was first proposed in 1978, and is based on a 20-item scale designed to measure subjective feelings of loneliness.

The options included ‘weekly’, ‘once or twice a month’, ‘only a few times a month’, and ‘not at all’. The options for happiness, on the other hand, included ‘very happy’, ‘quite happy’, ‘not very happy’ and ‘not at all happy’. In the chart I took this data, and I split the sample in two: I classified respondents as ‘often meeting with friends’ if they said they met with friends once a month or more frequently; and I classified them as ‘rarely meeting with friends’ if they said they met with friends ‘once a year’ or ‘not at all’. Then, for each of these two groups, I plotted the share who reported being ‘very happy’ or quite happy’.</p></li><li id="note-13"><p>The estimates have of course a margin of error that varies with the survey size.

There are of course many types of answers that people can provide to such an open-ended question, so the authors decided to classify each individual answer into one of two categories, depending on whether or not the respondents described a ‘socially engaged strategy’. This process of classifying answers could naturally raise questions: the authors could manipulate the subjective classification of answers to fit their favourite hypothesis. In order to insure themselves against this criticism, the researchers relied on three independent coders, and they stipulated the classification method and the expected results in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/a-pre-analysis-plan-checklist" target="_blank">pre-analysis plan</a>.

People who frequently interact with friends, or people who say they want to engage more in ‘social strategies to improve their lives’ are likely different; and although the researchers do try to control for this, it is very hard to measure all the relevant characteristics that might help drive life satisfaction. Similarly, asking people about strategies to improve their lives is difficult, and although the qualitative strategy from the paper above is interesting, it’s still hard to draw accurate comparisons: it’s possible that ‘non-social’ strategies, for example, are more difficult or stressful to pursue; so part of the lower apparent impact that these strategies have on happiness might come from the fact that some people are trying but failing to find a better job.</p></li><li id="note-18"><p>Romer’s seminal paper, with nearly 30,000 citations in Google Scholar is Romer, P.

Loosely speaking, the idea was that participants were paid to play a lottery: Everybody received the monetary incentive, but only those who ‘lost the lottery’ had to deactivate their account.</p></li><li id="note-56"><p>&nbsp;The paper provides the following definition for the variables: <em>The happiness variable is the average response to two questions from the Subjective Happiness Scale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper 1999), asking how happy participants were over the past four weeks and how happy they were compared to their peers. Life satisfaction is the sum of responses to three questions from the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener et al. 1985), such as the level of agreement with the statement, “During the past 4 weeks, I was satisfied with my life.” Loneliness is the Three-Item Loneliness Scale (Hughes et al. 2004). Finally, depressed, anxious, absorbed, and bored reflect how much of the time during the past four weeks respondents felt each emotion, using questions from the European Social Survey well-being module (Huppert et al. 2009). The daily text messages allowed us to measure the aspects of subjective well-being that are most important to record in the moment instead of retrospectively. This approach builds on the Experience Sampling Method of Csikszentmihalyi and Larson (2014) and Stone and Shiffman (1994). The variable SMS happiness is the answer to the question, “Overall, how happy do you feel right now on a scale from 1 (not at all happy) to 10 (completely happy)?” The variable SMS positive emotion is an indicator variable for whether the participant reports a positive emotion when asked, “What best describes how you felt over the last ten minutes?”, with possible responses such as “angry,” “worried,” “loving/tender,” etc. Finally, SMS not lonely uses the answer to the question, “How lonely are you feeling right now on a scale from 1 (not at all lonely) to 10 (very lonely)?”</em></p></li><li id="note-57"><p>&nbsp;To get a sense of the magnitudes of these effects, the authors discuss effect sizes in their original units, focusing on the measures with the largest effects. Happiness is the average response to two questions on a scale from 1 (not a very happy person) to 7 (a very happy person). The control group endline average is 4.47 out of a possible 7, and deactivation caused an average increase of 0.12. This is of course very, very small. In fact, the authors explain that given how small these effect sizes are, they would have been unlikely to have sufficient statistical power to detect any effects if they had used sample sizes similar to those from previous experiments in this field, all of which are much smaller.</p></li><li id="note-58"><p>&nbsp;In <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3312462">this other experiment</a>, quitting Facebook for a week led to a small but statistically significant decrease in self-reported feelings of depression, yet there was no significant effect on other measures of life satisfaction.
