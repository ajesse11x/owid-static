This was followed by South Asia at 19 percent.</p><p>The trajectory for Sub-Saharan Africa may look stubbornly flat, but the total number of primary school children out-of-school has fallen by 10 million since the late 1990s. Progress in getting children into school is even more marked when we look at the <em>share</em> of children not in school.</p><p>As of 2014, <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/Share-primary-school-age-out-of-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1-in-5 primary aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa were out-of-school</a></strong>.
