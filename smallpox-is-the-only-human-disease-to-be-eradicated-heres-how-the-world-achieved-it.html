No treatment existed so once you caught smallpox nothing could be done but let the infection run its course. Smallpox was responsible for millions of deaths in the past. The chart below illustrates this by visualizing the deaths due to smallpox as a share of all deaths in London from 1629 to 1902. In peak years, almost every fifth death was caused by smallpox! Death rates were similarly high in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-per-1000-population" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other European countries</a>.</p><p>In 1796, British surgeon Edward Jenner invented the smallpox vaccine, the world&#x2019;s first vaccine against any disease. The dramatic decrease in smallpox deaths at the turn of the 19th century can be credited to his invention. Our entry&#x2019;s section on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox#how-was-global-decline-eradication-achieved" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how eradication was achieved</a>, we discuss how Jenner discovered the virus that protected people against smallpox infections and how he initially struggled to spread the word about it.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-in-london" class="grapherPreview">
