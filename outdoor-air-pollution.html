<ul><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#outdoor-air-pollution-is-one-of-the-leading-risk-factors-for-premature-death">Outdoor air pollution is one of the leading risk factors for premature death. It&#x2019;s responsible for 3.4 million deaths each year.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#death-rates-from-ozone-and-particulate-matter-pollution">Ozone and particulate matter both have negative health impacts &#x2013; global death rates have fallen for both pollutants in recent decades.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#6-of-global-deaths-are-attributed-to-outdoor-air-pollution">6% of global deaths are attributed to outdoor air pollution. In some countries it&#x2019;s responsible for as many as 1-in-10 deaths.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#death-rates-tend-to-be-highest-across-middle-income-countries">Death rates from outdoor air pollution vary by a factor of 10 across the world. Death rates are typically highest in middle-income countries.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#outdoor-air-pollution-deaths-by-age">Older populations have the highest death rates from outdoor air pollution.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#how-are-deaths-from-outdoor-air-pollution-changing">Globally, and in most countries, the <em>number</em> of deaths from air pollution have increased. Population growth and ageing populations have been key drivers in this.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#death-rates-from-outdoor-air-pollution-have-fallen-in-around-half-of-countries">Death rates have increased in around half of countries, and fallen in half.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#concentrations-of-air-pollution">Particulate matter exposure is highest across low-to-middle income countries.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#share-exposed-to-air-pollution-above-who-limits">95% of the world population are exposed to mean concentrations of particulate matter which exceed the WHO recommended limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/outdoor-air-pollution#how-to-make-progress-against-outdoor-air-pollution">Levels of air pollution in rich countries are much lower than in the past &#x2013; to limit the health impacts of air pollution we must find solutions which accelerate this process for low-to-middle income countries.</a></li></ul>

<section><h2 id="death-rates-from-ozone-and-particulate-matter-pollution"><a class="deep-link" href="#death-rates-from-ozone-and-particulate-matter-pollution"></a>Death rates from ozone and particulate matter pollution</h2><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>There are two key local air pollutants which can have adverse health impacts: ozone and particulate matter. Death rates from particulate matter pollution tend to be higher than that of ozone.</p><p>Here, when we discuss ozone we mean &#x2018;tropospheric ozone&#x2019; &#x2013; that is, ozone which exists in the lower atmosphere, close to the surface. This is not to be confused with ozone in the stratosphere &#x2013; the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer">ozone layer</a> &#x2013; which is essential in protecting us from UV radiation. Local ozone close to the surface is often termed &#x2018;bad ozone&#x2019; and contrasted with the &#x2018;good ozone&#x2019; in the ozone layer.</p><p>Throughout our work on outdoor air pollution we often combine death rates from ozone and particulate matter pollution. But in the visualization here we show the breakdown of death rates from each. Also shown in this chart is the death rate from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution">indoor air pollution</a>. The global figures are shown here as the default, but this can be viewed for any country or region using the &#x201C;change country&#x201D; toggle on the chart.</p><p>We see that global death rates from total air pollution have fallen in recent decades. Most of the total decline is owed to improvements in indoor air pollution. Death rates from outdoor air pollution have also fallen, but less fast than the death rates caused by indoor air pollution: since 1990, particulate matter death rates have declined from 44 to 38 deaths per 100,000; for ozone, the rate has declined from 11 to 6 deaths per 100,000.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-air-pollution" class="grapherPreview">

Overall, the risk of premature mortality with exposure at the first interim target level (35&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>) is expected to increase the risk of premature mortality by 15% relative to the guideline value of 10&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>In the visualization we see the share of the population which is exposed to air pollution levels which exceed each of these interim targets, in addition to the 10&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup> guideline. </p><p>Note that you can explore this data across countries using the &#x201C;change country&#x201D; toggle on the chart.</p><p>If we take the UK as an example: we see that most people are exposed to air pollution levels above the 10&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup> guideline; but almost no one exceeds the 1st or 2nd interim target level of 35 or 25&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>; and it has made significant progress on reducing the share of people exposed to levels above the 3rd interim target of 15&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>. This is a pattern that we find across many high-income countries: most of the population have exposure in the range of 10 to 15&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>, with many countries struggling to reduce pollution levels below 10&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>In most low-to-middle income countries, much of the population is still exposed to pollution levels above the 1st interim target (35&#xB5;g/m<sup>3</sup>). In India, for example, 90% exceed this first target level, and 99% exceed the 2nd interim target.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/exposure-pollution-above-who-targets" class="grapherPreview">

But for rich countries today, this is far from true. Air pollution levels today are at some of their lowest levels in decades. </p><p>Here we take a look at air pollution trends in two countries for which we have good data for the last decades: the UK and US. </p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="decline-of-air-pollution-in-the-uk"><a class="deep-link" href="#decline-of-air-pollution-in-the-uk"></a>Decline of air pollution in the UK</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>In the visualization we see the relative change in emissions of air pollutants in the UK since 1970. Levels of emissions in 1970 (1980 for ammonia) are assigned a value of 100 &#x2013; this means a value of 40 would mean emissions in the given year were 40% of what they were in 1970 (a 60% decline). </p><p>We see a dramatic decline in emissions for all pollutants except ammonia (which is a gas typically produced in agriculture, and difficult to tackle). </p><p>By 2016, emissions of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/so-emissions-by-world-region-in-million-tonnes">sulphur dioxide</a> &#x2013; the gas that contributes to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/acidrain/what-acid-rain">acid rain</a>, an important environmental problem &#x2013; has fallen by more than 97%. Emissions of particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), which is the biggest threat to human health, fell by almost 80%; nitrous oxides fell by more than 70%.</p><p>What becomes clear is that far from being the most polluted in recent history, the air in many rich countries today is cleaner than it has been for decades. This does not mean we can&#x2019;t do more to generate cleaner cities and towns to live in &#x2013; there are large health and other benefits to doing so &#x2013; but it does show us that a combination of technological and political progress can be effective in reducing air pollution.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Related charts &#x2013; the absolute decline in emissions of air pollutants.</strong> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/air-pollutant-emissions?time=1970..2016">This chart</a> shows the decline in absolute emissions of nitrous oxides, sulphur dioxide and volatile organic compounds in the UK. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/emissions-of-particulate-matter?time=1970..2016">This chart</a> shows the absolute reduction in emissions of particulate matter.</p></blockquote></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/emissions-of-air-pollutants?time=1970..2016&amp;country=GBR" class="grapherPreview">

What determines the likelihood that a given individual will die prematurely from pollution-related illness? <br><br>It seems intuitive that the health impacts of air pollution would be strongly linked to the concentration of local pollutants (i.e. the exposure). But are there other factors at play? <br><br>In the visualization we see the death rate from outdoor particulate matter pollution (on the y-axis) plotted against the population-weighted exposure to particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentrations (on the x-axis).</p><p>Indeed, we see an overall correlation: the death rate from air pollution is higher in countries that have a higher level of pollution. There is also an important regional divide: most European, North American and Latin American countries cluster near the origin at low pollution levels and low death rates. Nearly all countries with either a high death rate or high pollution concentration (or both) are in Africa or&#xA0;Asia.</p><p>But what about some of the outliers? How do some countries with a high level of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution manage to maintain significantly lower death rates than we&#x2019;d expect? Countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, and the UAE have a comparably lower risk of premature death, despite high levels of pollution. They do, however, have a significantly higher GDP per capita than their neighbours (as evidenced by bubble size). Overall health, wellbeing and healthcare/medical standards in these nations significantly reduce the risk of mortality from respiratory illness. </p><p>The importance of good living standards is also likely to explain the other extreme, where countries such as Afghanistan and the Central African Republic have a very high death rate, despite having mid-range pollution levels. With low GDP levels, overall health and healthcare quality is likely to increase the burden of pollution-related disease.</p><p>Furthermore, many of the outliers on the right of the graphic (with high levels of particulate pollution and lower death rates) lie in the Middle East and North Africa. Drier conditions here mean the source of pollutants may be notably different from elsewhere: much of the local air pollution could be derived from dust and sand particles as opposed to anthropogenic sources of industry and agriculture. If proximal sand and dust sources have less severe impacts on health, this may explain the strong outliers from this world region.</p><p>If we want to reduce death rates from air pollution there are two important elements to tackle: a decline in the exposure to pollution, and improving overall health conditions and healthcare across the world.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rate-from-pm25-vs-pm25-concentration" class="grapherPreview">

The evolution over time also shows an increase-peak-reduction shape. </p><p>This trend is characteristic of what is called the &#x2018;Environmental Kuznets Curve&#x2019; (EKC). The concept of the EKC was first discussed in the 1990s within the 1992 World Development Report, but builds upon the stylized relationship between <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/" target="_blank">income inequality</a> and economic development as described by Simon Kuznets in 1955 &#x2013; he hypothesized that income inequality is low at low levels of prosperity and then rises with increasing prosperity, but eventually falls again at higher levels of average incomes.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>The EKC provides a hypothesis of the link between environmental degradation and economic development: environmental quality initially worsens with the onset of industrial growth, but then peaks at a certain stage of economic development and from then on environmental quality begins to improve with increased development. Evidence of the EKC is mixed: across various measures it has been widely contested, but for a number of environmental markers there is strong evidence for the existence of EKC relationship. For example, a recent study published in <em>Science</em> suggests the EKC relationship also appears in links between deforestation, afforestation and economic growth.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>In regard to air pollution we see this in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/so-emissions-per-capita-tonnes-per-year">trends of sulphur dioxide</a> (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions &#x2013; they tend to follow an inverted-U shape, first rising with industrialization before peaking and falling rapidly with development.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>This also appears to be reflected in the data when we look at death rates from outdoor air pollution versus income by country as shown in the scatterplot here.

Dense cities not only have the problem that air pollution levels tend to be higher, but also that they can expose large populations to its impacts.</p><p>What we see from historical data is that this rise in pollution is a pathway that is typical of developing cities. And it&#x2019;s one where emissions level peak and can then fall dramatically.</p><p>If we take a historical&#xA0;look at pollution levels in London, for example, we see this &#x2018;Kuznet&#x2019;s Curve&#x2019; clearly. In the visualization we have plotted the average&#xA0;levels of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in London&#x2019;s air from 1700 to 2016. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) refers to fine solid or liquid particles which are suspended in Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere (such as soot, smoke, dust and pollen). The data presented below has been kindly provided by&#xA0;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/profile/roger-fouquet/" target="_blank">Roger Fouquet</a>, who has studied the topic of environmental quality, energy costs and economic development in great detail.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p><p>As we see, from&#xA0;1700 on, London experienced a worsening of air pollution decade after decade. Over the course of two centuries the suspended particulate matter in London&#x2019;s air doubled. But at the very end of the 19th century the concentration reached a peak and then began a steep decline so that today&#x2019;s levels are almost 40-times lower than at that peak more than a century ago. </p><p>To provide context of pollution in today&#x2019;s growing megacities, we have also shown levels in Delhi in India. Pollution in Delhi is <em>much</em> worse than in London today, but not dissimilar from levels during London&#x2019;s period of rapid industrialization. In our post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/london-air-pollution"><strong>here</strong></a> we look in more detail at what today&#x2019;s megacities can learn from London&#x2019;s pollution of the past. They key takeaway is that city pollution is not unprecedented in a historical perspective &#x2013; and we know that with development levels peak and eventually decline. But to successfully address the large health burdens of air pollution today we must find solutions which accelerate this process for low-to-middle income countries.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/air-pollution-london-vs-delhi" class="grapherPreview">

These measurements are, however, often limited to major city centres.</p><p>Many low- and middle-income countries lack sufficient data coverage altogether. To provide an extensive and consistent view of air pollution levels across a given country, and for global comparison, we therefore have to rely on additional methods of measurement. Data is therefore collected through a combination of satellite observations, global air transport models, local meteorological conditions, and local ground measurements where available. Exposure to PM2.5 and O<sub>3</sub> is then calculated across grid cells of 0.1 x 0.1 degrees longitude and latitude (11km x 11km at the equator). With data on population density within each grid cell, we can then calculate the population-weighted average exposure of the population of a given country.</p><p>In the case of ozone, meteorological data is used to report a seasonal average concentration for summer (when concentrations are highest).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-do-we-estimate-the-number-of-deaths-and-dal-ys-lost-from-air-pollution"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-we-estimate-the-number-of-deaths-and-dal-ys-lost-from-air-pollution"></a>How do we estimate the number of deaths and DALYs lost from air pollution?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>It&#x2019;s important to emphasize the difficulties in directly attributing deaths to air pollution. A &#x2018;death&#x2019; from air pollution <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.stateofglobalair.org/data/methods" target="_blank">is defined</a> as someone who dies prematurely (could be in the range of months or years) than would be expected in the absence of air pollution. In many cases, air pollution exacerbates pre-existing cardiorespiratory illnesses&#x2014;individuals suffering from asthma, for example, are particularly vulnerable. We link pollution concentrations to health risks using empirical exposure-response relationships and their relation to mortality rates.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>Absolute number of deaths gives no indication of the age at which an individual died prematurely. For this, we use a measure of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost. DALYs lost provide an overall measure of the loss of healthy life expectancy and are calculated as the sum of the healthy years of life lost from a premature death linked to a pollution-related illness, and the years lived with disability caused by the attributable&#xA0;disease attributable to air pollution. The DALYs of a child who suffered mortality from a pollution-related illness will be significantly higher than an older individual.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-do-we-estimate-the-death-and-daly-loss-rate-from-air-pollution"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-we-estimate-the-death-and-daly-loss-rate-from-air-pollution"></a>How do we estimate the death and DALY loss&#xA0;<em>rate</em>&#xA0;from air pollution?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The death and DALY loss rate of air pollution is measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 people.

This has forced the adoption of emissions reduction technologies such as ‘scrubbers’ which strip the gases of sulphur before being emitted, as well as a migration away from cheaper coal and oil sources which typically have higher sulphur contents.</p></li><li id="note-13"><p>Kunnas, J. &amp; Myllyntaus, T.
