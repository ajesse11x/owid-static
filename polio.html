<section><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Polio is an infectious disease, contracted predominantly by children, that can lead to the permanent paralysis of various body parts and can ultimately cause death by immobilizing the patient&#x2019;s breathing muscles.</p><p>No cure exists for the symptoms, but&#xA0;in the 1950s effective vaccines were developed and have been used around the world since then. This allowed some richer countries to eliminate the disease entirely in the 1960s and 70s. But large outbreaks continued around the world and in the 1980s the estimated global number of paralytic cases was over 350,000 per year and the disease was still prevalent in 125 countries. As a response the &#x201C;Global Polio Eradication Initiative&#x201D; (GPEI) was founded in 1988 to fight the virus&#x2019;s spread and disease burden with a global vaccination campaign. Since then the world has made rapid progress against the disease and until 2016 the number of paralytic cases was reduced by 99.99% with 42 cases in that year worldwide.

One of the severe symptoms of polio is&#xA0;paralysis and the disease is therefore also known as &#x201C;infantile paralysis&#x201D;. The name poliomyelitis is derived from Greek and translates to gray (polios) marrow (myelon), which refers to the tissue in the center of the spinal cord, which when affected causes paralysis. Paralyzed limbs such as arms or legs waste away over time which is the cause of deformed child legs most commonly being associated with the disease polio.</p><p>Permanent paralysis fortunately occurs in only 0.5% of infections.&#xA0;The majority of infections (72%) do not lead to any symptoms. About a quarter of cases&#xA0;(24%) result in &#x201C;abortive&#x201D; poliomyelitis which leads to nonspecific symptoms for a few days, such as a fever or a cold, and 1-5% of cases lead to &#x201C;non-paralytic aseptic meningitis&#x201D;, in which the patient suffers from stiff limbs for up to 10 days.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>The poliovirus is found only among humans and is transmitted via the so-called fecal-oral route. In other words, polio is mostly transmitted by drinking water that has been contaminated by the feces of a person carrying the poliovirus. The virus therefore spreads especially well in conditions of poor sanitation, for example when people defecate in the open or do not filter their water before drinking it. The fact that the virus can only survive in humans (and no other animals) makes it possible to completely eradicate the disease from the world &#x2013; if it was a virus with an animal host such as influenza (birds) or tuberculosis (cows) that occasionally mutates to attack humans, polio could only ever be controlled but not eradicated.</p><p>Its relatively long incubation period of up to 10 days and three fourths of infections not showing any symptoms makes polio extremely difficult to monitor and the virus can spread for several months without being detected. Monitoring has to focus on identifying patients that suffer from symptoms or rely on stool samples.&#xA0;Because single identified cases might indicate larger outbreaks, the WHO recommends to treat such cases as a public health emergency when only one child is identified with a wild, endemic polio infection in a country that was previously declared polio free.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="fighting-polio-s-symptoms-the-iron-lung"><a class="deep-link" href="#fighting-polio-s-symptoms-the-iron-lung"></a>Fighting polio&#x2019;s symptoms: The &#x2018;Iron Lung&#x2019;</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Polio can lead to the death of infected patients when the paralysis is immobilizing their breathing muscles.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a>To prevent the death by suffocation, Harvard professors Philip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw invented the so called &#x201C;iron lung&#x201D;<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> (shown in the picture) in 1928. Infected patients would be placed in an air-tight tube &#x2013; with their heads outside &#x2013; and the machine decreased the pressure inside the box, to induce inhalation, before returning to the normal outside pressure conditions, to induce exhalation.&#xA0;Most patients would spend one to two weeks in an iron lung before their paralytic symptoms faded and independent breathing was achieved once again. In the case of permanent paralysis, on the other hand, patients would be bound to live inside the iron lung for years.</p><p>As it is often the case with innovations, the iron lung became only widespread when the price declined substantially. John Emerson managed to construct an iron lung at half the cost in 1931. In the meantime, Philip Drinker had tried to protect his invention with a patent and therefore filed a lawsuit against Emerson for using the original iron lung set-up. Emerson did not succumb, claiming that life-saving devices should be made available to the public at low cost rather than be used for private financial gains, and in the end, Drinker&#x2019;s lawsuit failed.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>The falling price of the Iron Lung enabled mass distribution and widespread use from the end of the 1930s onwards. The cost of one iron lung in the 1930s amounted to US-$1,500, which is the equivalent of approximately US-$26,000 in 2016 when accounting for inflation.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p> The design quickly spread to Western Europe and was widely used for polio patients there, too.</p><p>The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910?time=1910..2010">data visualization further below</a>, which shows the&#xA0;prevalence of polio in the US over the last century, shows two large outbreaks in 1916 and 1952. It can be seen that in 1916, before the widespread use of iron lungs, the death rate increased sharply when the case rate increased. But after the widespread use of iron lungs from 1939 onwards and during the largest polio outbreak in the US in the 1950s the death rate did not show the same strongly correlated increase anymore. This is because the breathing assistance of the iron lungs prevented the deaths of the many polio patients suffering from paralyzed breathing muscles &#x2013; the iron lungs were a large step forward in mankind&#x2019;s struggle against polio.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>A hospital room in the US with patients in iron lungs in 1952<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom-733x550.jpg" alt="Polio ironlungs hospitalroom" class="wp-image-14453" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom-733x550.jpg 733w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom-150x113.jpg 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom-400x300.jpg 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom-768x576.jpg 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div></section>

This changed around the beginning of the 20th century. Major epidemics occurred in Norway and Sweden around 1905 and later also in the United States.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>Why did we see such large outbreaks of polio only in the 20th century?&#xA0;Or, in other words, why did the transition from the <em>endemic</em> to the <em>epidemic</em> phase take place?</p><p>The answer, again, lies with hygiene standards. As polio is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, the lack of flush toilets and the lack of safe drinking water meant that children in the past were usually exposed to the poliovirus before their first birthday already. At such a young age, children still benefit from a passive immunity that is passed on from their mothers in the form of antibodies. These are proteins that identify the poliovirus as something foreign and therefore signal to the body that they should be eliminated (done by either the antibodies themselves or different cells called macrophages). Thereby, virtually all children would contract the poliovirus at a very young age. While protected from developing the disease thanks to the maternal antibodies, their bodies would produce their own memory cells in response to the virus and that ensured long-term immunity against polio. The latter is important as the mother&#x2019;s cells have a half-life of only 30 days (starting from the last day of breastfeeding).<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p> Once the maternal antibodies decrease in number, children lose their passive immunity.</p><p>As hygiene standards improved, the age at which children were first exposed to the poliovirus increased and this meant that the maternal antibodies were no longer present to protect children from polio.</p><p>That improved sanitation was a driving factor in polio outbreaks is also illustrated by the fact that the age at which polio was contracted increased over time. During five US epidemics in the time period 1907-1912, most reported cases occurred in one- to five-year-olds, whereas during the 1950s the average age of contraction was 6 years with &#x201C;a substantial proportion of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults&#x201D;.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p> Being exposed to the poliovirus after losing the protection from maternal antibodies meant that they were more likely to get polio, resulting in an increase in case and death numbers around the turn of the 19th and 20th century.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-history-of-polio-in-the-us"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-history-of-polio-in-the-us"></a>The history of polio in the US</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The chart here shows the annual absolute number of reported deaths and cases in the United States over the last century; the corresponding perspective on the <em>rate</em> of deaths and cases is shown in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-polio-rates-in-the-united-states-1910-2010">this visualization</a>. Big outbreaks happened frequently. In 1916 for example, the poliovirus infected more than 27,000 Americans and killed more than 7,000 people.&#xA0;At that time, the cause and spread of the disease was not yet known, so panicked New Yorkers shut down schools, public cinemas, and swimming pools. For a while it was believed that cats or mosquitoes were spreading the virus which lead to the killing of more than 72,000 cats and the extensive spraying of the insecticide DDT, in a futile attempt to interrupt the transmission of the virus.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>Each of these large outbreaks came to an end because, like most viral diseases, the spread of the poliovirus in moderate climates like in the USA is seasonal and is mostly transmitted during the summer months. By October 1916, enough New Yorkers had been infected and developed immunity in response so that in combination with the natural seasonal decline of the virus&#x2019;s spread the case numbers had already dramatically dropped and would not surge again. This can be seen in the graph as the US recorded less than 5,000 cases in&#xA0;the following year. Containing the second major outbreak in the USA in the 1950s, on the other hand, was largely aided by the successful development of polio vaccines that would hinder the transmission of the virus.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910" class="grapherPreview">

US President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself had been diagnosed with polio at the age of 39 and subsequently bound to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. While this might have been a misdiagnosis in Roosevelt&#x2019;s case,<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> his presidential influence was crucial in the set-up of the&#xA0;<em>National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis</em>. The non-profit organization soon became known as &#x201C;The March of Dimes Foundation&#x201D;, referring to polio victims&#x2019; inability to walk, and successfully collected a substantial amount of donations for vaccine research and its &#x2018;Iron Lung&#x2019; distribution program.</p><p>Years of research went into the effort to develop an effective vaccine. The chart shows the large increase in scientific publications on polio in the 1950s.</p><p>The medical doctor and virologist Jonas Salk put forward a promising vaccine and in the spring of 1953, the foundation rolled out a large-scale trial of the Salk vaccine for which 1.83 million children in 44 US states received either a placebo or the vaccine shot.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a> Salk&#x2019;s supervisor Thomas Francis insisted to introduce a control group into the trial design and thereby paved the way for Randomized Control Trials, which have become a very influential method in medical and social science research in the following decades. The foundation was supported mainly by donations from the American people, who were collecting dimes, quarters, and dollars for decades in the hope of research finally uncovering a way to protect oneself against polio. Oshinsky (2005) even reports that the foundation received donations from two-thirds of the US population and a poll claims that more Americans knew about the field trials than about the president&#x2019;s full name (Dwight David Eisenhower).<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><p>On April 12, 1955, the tenth anniversary of Roosevelt&#x2019;s death, Francis announced that Salk&#x2019;s vaccine was effective and potent in preventing polio. Within just two hours, the US Public Health Service issued a production license and the foundation prepared for a national immunization program. The conference had been live-broadcasted to physicians all over the country who had gathered in movie theaters to watch the announcement, millions of Americans received the news over the radio, spontaneously putting down their work in celebration of the news.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></p><p> At 10:30PM of the same day, Thomas Francis and Jonas Salk gave a televised live broadcast interview in which Salk, when asked who owned the patents to the vaccine, famously answered <em>&#x201C;Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?&#x201D;</em><a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a></p><p> His answer was in the spirit of the foundation having funded the vaccine research with American&#x2019;s private donations and his conviction that life-saving technology should be for the benefit of society as a whole rather than for private financial gains.</p><p>Shortly afterwards Dr. Albert Sabin introduced a live polio vaccine that could be administered orally (rather than Salk&#x2019;s by injection), the oral polio vaccine (OPV).<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p> While Salk&#x2019;s vaccine only protected the central nervous system, Sabin&#x2019;s vaccine also protected the digestive tract and thereby prevented the spread of the wild polio virus more effectively. The easier administration also made vaccination efforts less expensive as it did not require trained health workers. For these reasons, OPV has been used around the world and it is the vaccination that is responsible for the dramatic reduction in polio infections globally that we document below.</p><p>The graph of the number of reported polio cases and deaths in the United States shown above shows the impact the national immunization scheme had: Within 7 years, the number of reported polio cases went below 1,000 and by 1979 the US was declared polio-free. It is easier to see this decline if you switch the y-axis in that chart from linear to logarithmic.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Numbers of publications about polio by year, 1890 to 1986 &#x2013; Cambridge World History of Human Diseases<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Numbers-of-publications-about-polio-by-year-1890-to-1986-&#x2013;-Cambridge-World-History-of-Human-Diseases-651x550.png" alt="Numbers of publications about polio by year 1890 to 1986 &#x2013; cambridge world history of human diseases" class="wp-image-14443" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Numbers-of-publications-about-polio-by-year-1890-to-1986-&#x2013;-Cambridge-World-History-of-Human-Diseases-651x550.png 651w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Numbers-of-publications-about-polio-by-year-1890-to-1986-&#x2013;-Cambridge-World-History-of-Human-Diseases-150x127.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Numbers-of-publications-about-polio-by-year-1890-to-1986-&#x2013;-Cambridge-World-History-of-Human-Diseases-400x338.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Numbers-of-publications-about-polio-by-year-1890-to-1986-&#x2013;-Cambridge-World-History-of-Human-Diseases-768x649.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Numbers-of-publications-about-polio-by-year-1890-to-1986-&#x2013;-Cambridge-World-History-of-Human-Diseases.png 1442w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Numbers-of-publications-about-polio-by-year-1890-to-1986-&#x2013;-Cambridge-World-History-of-Human-Diseases.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="vaccine-induced-polio"><a class="deep-link" href="#vaccine-induced-polio"></a>Vaccine-induced polio</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Unfortunately it is possible that the altered live poliovirus that is used in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and thereby regains its &#x201C;neurovirulence&#x201D;. Thankfully it happens extremely rarely (more below), but it means that recipients of the OPV can develop the paralytic symptoms from the vaccine.</p><p>There exist two types of vaccine-induced polio, VAPP and cVDPV:</p><ul><li>If the mutation is spontaneous, one refers to <em>Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Polio</em> (VAPP) which is not infectious. It is estimated that it occurs once per 2.7 million doses of OPV.<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></li><li>If the mutation happens over the course of at least one year by transmission among an under-immunized community, the virus can transform to resemble the wild type of poliovirus. This is then known as a <em>circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus</em> (cVDPV) and this virus can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route to other humans. Since 2000, 10 billion doses of OPV have been distributed worldwide and only 24 cVDPV outbreaks have occurred, counting less than 760 cases.<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a></li></ul><p> As the attenuated vaccine virus requires conditions of low vaccine coverage to develop into a VDPV, it is not the vaccine itself, but low immunization rates that pose the problem.

</p><p>The chart shows the number of circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks between 2000 and May 2016. More than 90% of the vaccine-derived viruses were of serotype 2, a variation of the virus whose wild-type equivalent was already globally eradicated in 1999. Therefore, the <em>Global Polio Eradication Initiative</em> switched from an OPV that protects against all three serotypes to one that only protects against serotypes 1 and 3 in April 2016 and this has led to a dramatic decline in vaccine-derived polio viruses.</p><p>Further below, in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#health-benefits">section II.4 The benefits of eradicating polio</a>, we show that since 1988 16 million cases of paralytic polio have been averted thanks to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative&#x2019;s (GPEI) vaccination campaigns.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a></p><p> Moreover, the initiative has declared it its goal of switching to the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), an updated version of the Salk vaccine, which is administered by injection and does not bear the risk of vaccine-derived polio strands.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>The global number of circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (cVDPV), January 2000 &#x2013; May 2016<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Vaccine-derived-Polio-Virus-decline-750x429.gif" alt="Vaccine derived Polio Virus decline" class="wp-image-14342" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Vaccine-derived-Polio-Virus-decline-750x429.gif 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Vaccine-derived-Polio-Virus-decline-150x86.gif 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Vaccine-derived-Polio-Virus-decline-400x229.gif 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Vaccine-derived-Polio-Virus-decline-768x440.gif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Vaccine-derived-Polio-Virus-decline.gif" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="polio-prevalence-in-the-developing-world-and-the-global-spread-of-the-polio-vaccine"><a class="deep-link" href="#polio-prevalence-in-the-developing-world-and-the-global-spread-of-the-polio-vaccine"></a>Polio prevalence in the developing world and the global spread of the polio vaccine</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Dr. Sabin&#x2019;s <em>Oral Poliovirus Vaccine</em> (OPV) was tested on more than 100 million people in the Soviet Union before obtaining its license in 1961.

It was only during the 1970s and 1980s with several polio surveys throughout the developing world that became known as &#x201C;lameness surveys&#x201D; that it became apparent that polio was as much a problem in developing countries as it was in Western Europe and the United States.

They had achieved that by way of routine immunization programs which entails the basic schedule of each child receiving three Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) before its first birthday. Since its inauguration in 1988, the GPEI has offered support for these routine immunization programs to governments, but in addition to these the GPEI also ran</p><ul><li><em>National Immunization Days</em> (NIDs), on which children receive two doses of OPV 4-8 weeks apart regardless of their immunization history,</li><li><em>outbreak response immunization programs</em>, for which all children below the age of five years in the vicinity of a detected case of paralytic polio receive one OPV dose, and</li><li><em>mopping-up immunization programs</em>, during which under-five-year-olds living in outbreak-prone areas are visited in their homes and receive two OPV doses one month apart.</li></ul><p>Even though the GPEI has not yet reached the goal of eradicating polio, it has been successful in reducing the prevalence of polio around the world: reported polio cases have been reduced by 99.99% and two of its three serotypes have already been eradicated. In 2017 the polio virus is endemic in three countries only: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan &#x2013; colored in dark red in the map. Up-to-date information on polio is available on the website of the GPEI <a href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/">here</a>.</p><p>Because of the increasing burden of <em>vaccine-derived paralytic polioviruses</em> (cVDPV), the GPEI has switched from the oral polio vaccine (OPV) against all three strands of poliovirus (see our explanation of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#vaccine-induced-polio">cVDPVs above</a>) to a &#x201C;bivalent&#x201D; OPV against only strands 1 and 3. Furthermore,&#xA0;in 2012 the initiative announced its goal of entirely phasing out <em>orally-administrated vaccines</em> (OPVs) and use only <em>injection-administrated vaccines</em> (IPVs) instead as part of the <a href="http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PEESP_EN_A4.pdf">Polio Eradication &amp; Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018</a>.

The initiative hopes to especially finance the last stretch of vaccination campaigns in the three countries where polio is still endemic today (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria), keep the remaining countries, especially in the vicinity of the former, polio-free and closely monitor the occurrence for at least three years after the last reported case. Even though the additional financial needs seem very high, the GPEI argues that eradication is the most cost-effective strategy, by illustrating in their graphic reproduced here that the <em>long-term</em> costs of controlling rather than eradicating will be substantially higher.</p><p>The benefits of eradicating polio extend beyond the <em>health</em> domain of having less people suffering paralytic polio. In the <em>economic</em> domain, less polio patients translates into lower healthcare costs. Furthermore, once the virus has been eradicated, the world can stop the production and administration of&#xA0;the polio vaccine as well as the extensive surveillance of paralytic diseases suspected to be polio. The discontinuation of these costly activities will therefore result in extensive economic gains from eradication, as well. It is very difficult to accurately estimate these economic gains as it requires assumptions on for example the marginal economic value of a healthy person over a paralyzed polio patient or until what year you calculate these gains for. Tebbens et al. (2010)<a id="ref-45" class="ref" href="#note-45"><sup>45</sup></a> have attempted such a modeling exercise and arrive at a net benefit of adding GPEI vis-&#xE0;-vis just national routine immunization of US-$40-50 billion in their chosen time horizon of 1988 to 2035.

Therefore, it should be taken into account that data on polio &#x2013; especially historical data &#x2013; is associated with considerable mismeasurement.

Having to report <em>all</em> cases of AFP in any child under 15 years of age means that a country with a good monitoring system in place should detect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190410031140/http://polioeradication.org:80/who-we-are/strategy/surveillance/" rel="noopener">at least 1 AFP case per 100,000 under-15-year-olds</a>. If the number of AFP cases is less than 1 per 100,000 under-15-year-olds then there is reason to suspect that paralytic polio cases too are underreported.</p><p>Each case of AFP should be followed by a diagnosis to find its cause. Within 14 days of the onset of AFP two stool samples should be collected 24 to 48 hours apart and need to be sent to a GPEI accredited laboratory to be tested for the poliovirus.<a id="ref-51" class="ref" href="#note-51"><sup>51</sup></a> Since 2000, the <a rel="noopener" href="https://extranet.who.int/polis/public/CaseCount.aspx">WHO reports</a> these surveillance quality indicators on a yearly basis for each country as the &#x201C;Non polio AFP Rate&#x201D; and &#x201C;% Adequate Stool Collection&#x201D;, respectively.</p><p>These WHO data were used for the <a rel="noopener" href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#economic-savings">Tebbens et al. (2011) model on the economic benefits of polio&#x2019;s eradication</a> to generate an estimate of the <em>actual total</em> number of paralytic polio cases based on the <em>reported</em> number of paralytic polio cases and a correction factor for the share of not-reported paralytic polio cases. The section A of the graphic shows the correction factor the authors used &#x2013; the number of reported paralytic cases was multiplied by this factor to arrive at their estimate of the true total number of paralytic polio cases. The authors estimate that in the 1980s and 1990s the number of reported paralytic polio cases was around 7-fold lower than the true total number. One crucial piece of information for the estimation of this correction factor is that several developing countries administered surveys specifically on paralysis in the 1980s and arrived at paralytic polio case counts much higher than the initially reported figures.</p><p>As shown in section B of the graphic, Tebbens et al. (2011) estimate the total global number of paralytic polio cases to be around 270,000 per year in the late 1980s when the <a rel="noopener" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-number-of-reported-polio-cases-by-world-region">reported</a>&#xA0;number of cases&#xA0;only surmounts to around 30,000 paralytic cases per year.</p><p>Many official sources, such as the <a href="http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AR2016_EN.pdf" rel="noopener">Annual Report of the GPEI in 2016</a>, cite the number of paralytic cases to be more than 350,000 in some years in the 1980s and accordingly estimate the correction factor to be even larger than 7. It is therefore even more remarkable that as reporting standards improved over time &#x2013; and a greater number of paralytic polio cases are detected and reported &#x2013; the number of paralytic polio cases dropped&#xA0;dramatically, so that only 42 paralytic polio cases were reported in 2016.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Tebben et al.&#x2019;s (2011) correction factor and the resulting estimated total number of paralytic polio cases <a id="ref-52" class="ref" href="#note-52"><sup>52</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases.png" alt="Correction factor and estimated total cases" class="wp-image-14492" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases.png 3000w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases-150x45.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases-400x121.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases-768x232.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases-750x226.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases.png" loading="lazy"></figure></div></div></div></section>

The source notes: “The figures are not entirely comparable: The Current Bibliography of Poliomyelitis includes some papers about other viruses; Index Medicus<br>
puts the entry for a single paper in more than one section, so that the number of papers is overestimated by perhaps 5 percent. Entries in the Bibliography of Infantile Paralysis are listed by year of publication, whereas other bibliographies list entries by year of appearance in the secondary serial (e.g., 6 months later). The effects of world wars, slumps, large epidemics, and notable research findings are apparent (see J. R. Paul 1971). The peak of papers in 1984 is due to an international conference held in 1983.”</p></li><li id="note-26"><p>GPEI.

This means that our comparisons are possibly slightly inaccurate; however, at currently low inflation levels however comparisons will not be vastly inaccurate if US-$ sums are compared which are based on base years that are surely relatively close.</p></li><li id="note-45"><p>Tebbens, R., Pallansch, M., Cochi, S., Wassilak, S., Linkins, J., &amp; Sutter, R. et al.
