Indeed, in most countries basic education is nowadays perceived not only as a right, but also as a duty &#x2013; governments are typically expected to ensure access to basic education, while citizens are often required by law to attain education up to a certain basic level.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>In this entry we begin by providing an overview of long run changes in education <em>outcomes and outputs</em> across the world, focusing both on quantity and quality measures of education attainment; and then provide an analysis of available evidence on the <em>determinants and consequences</em> of education.</p><p>From a historical perspective, the world went through a great expansion in education over the past two centuries. This can be seen across all quantity measures. Global literacy rates have been climbing over the course of the last two centuries, mainly though increasing rates of enrollment in primary education. Secondary and tertiary education have also seen drastic growth, with global average years of schooling being much higher now than a hundred years ago. Despite all these worldwide improvements, some countries have been lagging behind, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, where there are still countries that have literacy rates below 50% among the youth.</p><p>Data on the production of education shows that schooling tends to be largely financed with public resources across the globe, although a great deal of heterogeneity is observed between countries and world regions. Since differences in national expenditure on education do not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes, the data suggests that generic policies that increase expenditure on standard inputs, such as the number of teachers, are unlikely to be effective to improve education outcomes.</p><p>Regarding the consequences of education, a growing body of empirical research suggests that better education yields higher individual income and contributes towards the construction of social capital and long-term economic growth.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="block-wrapper" data-reactroot><div data-variation="full-width" class="wp-block-owid-additional-information"><h3 id="all-our-charts-on-global-education"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="angle-right" class="svg-inline--fa fa-angle-right fa-w-8 " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M224.3 273l-136 136c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.6-22.6c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l96.4-96.4-96.4-96.4c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L54.3 103c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l136 136c9.5 9.4 9.5 24.6.1 34z"/></svg>All our charts on Global Education</h3><div style="height:0;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" class="rah-static rah-static--height-zero"><div style="transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;-webkit-transition:opacity 250ms ease 0ms;opacity:0"><div class="content">

UNESCO operationalizes the measurement of literacy as the ability to both read and write a short, simple statement about one&#x2019;s own life. Literacy rates are determined by literacy questions in a census or sample survey of a population, in standardized tests of literacy, or via extrapolation from statistics about school enrollment and educational attainment.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>Statistics of literacy rates for recent decades are published by statistical offices. For earlier periods, historians have to reconstruct data from other sources. The most common method is to calculate the share of those people who could sign official documents (e.g. court documents).</p><p><em><strong>Our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy">Literacy</a> contains further in-depth information on the topic.</strong> </em></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-has-global-literacy-evolved-in-the-last-two-centuries"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-has-global-literacy-evolved-in-the-last-two-centuries"></a>How has global literacy evolved in the last two centuries?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>While the earliest forms of written communication date back to about 3,500-3,000 BCE, literacy remained for centuries a very restricted technology closely associated with the exercise of power. It was only until the Middle Ages that book production started growing and literacy among the general population slowly started becoming important in the Western World.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>In fact, while the ambition of universal literacy in Europe was a fundamental reform born from the Enlightment, it took centuries for it to happen. Even in early-industrialized countries it was only in the 19th and 20th centuries that rates of literacy approached universality.</p><p>The visualization presents estimates of world literacy for the period 1800-2014. As we can see, literacy rates grew constantly but rather slowly until the beginning of the twentieth century. And the rate of growth really climbed after the middle of the 20th century, when the expansion of basic education became a global priority.

Here we focus on evidence of access to education, as measured by school <em>attendance</em>. The difference lies in the source of information regarding participation: enrollment figures come from official records, while attendance estimates comes from asking households directly.</p><p>In the majority of developing countries, net enrollment rates are higher than attendance rates. This reflects the fact that many children who are officially enrolled, do not regularly attend school. The visualization, from the UNESCO report <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/oosc05-en.pdf">Measuring Exclusion From Primary Education (2005)</a>, shows the relationship between these two measures. The source reports that &#x201C;among the 59 countries with comparable data, in 24 countries participation rates drop by five percentage points for the primary school-age group when household surveys are used instead of administrative data.&#x201D;<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>The interactive map shows recent primary school attendance estimates for a selection of (mainly) low and middle income countries in Africa, where the gaps between attendance and enrollment are largest.

Roughly speaking, you can think of this graph as a &#x2018;smooth histogram&#x2019;: if all people in the world were ranked by years of education, this chart would approximately tell us, for any number of years in the horizontal axis, the proportion of the world population that achieved those years.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>We can see that in 1870, the distribution was concentrated at the left: most of the people had between 0 and 3 years of education. In contrast, by 2010 the distribution had shifted drastically to the right.</p><p>We can see that there has been a continuous rightward shift in the successive distributions of schooling across time. This reflects the fact that there has been a continuous increase in average years of schooling worldwide: as the share of the uneducated population fell over time, the concentration at the lower level became less pronounced.</p><p>The increasingly long tails that we see in the distributions, are the result of cross-country inequalities in education expansion &#x2013; in the long run, we can see that there has been a considerable increase in the <em>dispersion</em> of the years of schooling. This is mainly the result of cross-country differences, since some nations started expanding education much later than other, and some are still lagging behind. Interestingly, however, inequality grew in the period 1870-1950, but after this point, it has slowly started going down (notice that the distribution in 2010 is &#x2018;bulkier&#x2019; in the middle, vis-a-vis the distribution in 1950). Below we provide more detailed evidence of how education inequality has been going down since 1950.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>World distribution of years of schooling for selected years &#x2013; Figure 7B in Lee and Lee (2016)<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/LeeLee2016_YearsSchool.png" alt="LeeLee2016_YearsSchool" class="wp-image-8573" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/LeeLee2016_YearsSchool.png 1506w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/LeeLee2016_YearsSchool-150x104.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/LeeLee2016_YearsSchool-400x278.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/LeeLee2016_YearsSchool-768x534.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/LeeLee2016_YearsSchool-750x522.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1506px) 100vw, 1506px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/LeeLee2016_YearsSchool.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="school-life-expectancy-captures-the-years-of-schooling-children-can-expect"><a class="deep-link" href="#school-life-expectancy-captures-the-years-of-schooling-children-can-expect"></a>School life expectancy captures the years of schooling children can expect</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if the current age-specific enrollment rates persist throughout the child&#x2019;s life by country.<br>This is shown in the map.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/expected-years-of-schooling" class="grapherPreview">

The time-series chart shows inequality by age group. It can be seen that as inequality is falling over time, the level of inequality is higher for older generations than it is for younger generations. We can also see that in the period 1960-2010, education inequality went down every year, for all age groups and in all world regions.</p><p>Have gains from historical education expansion fully materialized? The breakdown by age gives us a view into the future: as the inequality is lower among today&#x2019;s younger generations, we can expect the decline of inequality to continue in the future. Thus, further reductions in education inequality are still to be expected within developing countries; and if the expansion of global education can be continued, we can speed up this important process of global convergence.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Education Gini coefficients by world region for selected age groups, 1960- 2010 &#x2013; Figure 4 in Crespo Cuaresma et al.

Such distribution of private household contributions to education is regressive.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Percentage of total education expenditures contributed directly by households in 30 countries, grouped by country income &#x2013; Figure 32 in <a href="http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Investment_Case_for_Education_and_Equity_FINAL.pdf">The Investment Case for Education and Equity (UNICEF &#x2013; 2015)</a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/UNICEF-Private-Education-Expenditure-Levels-440x550.png" alt="UNICEF Private Education Expenditure Levels" class="wp-image-8145" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/UNICEF-Private-Education-Expenditure-Levels-440x550.png 440w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/UNICEF-Private-Education-Expenditure-Levels-120x150.png 120w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/UNICEF-Private-Education-Expenditure-Levels-320x400.png 320w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/UNICEF-Private-Education-Expenditure-Levels-768x961.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/UNICEF-Private-Education-Expenditure-Levels.png 1664w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/UNICEF-Private-Education-Expenditure-Levels.png"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="the-link-between-expenditure-and-outcomes"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-link-between-expenditure-and-outcomes"></a>The link between expenditure and outcomes</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="do-countries-that-spend-more-public-resources-on-education-tend-to-have-better-education-outcomes"><a class="deep-link" href="#do-countries-that-spend-more-public-resources-on-education-tend-to-have-better-education-outcomes"></a>Do countries that spend more public resources on education tend to have better education outcomes?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The visualization presents three scatter plots using 2010 data to show the cross-country correlation between (i) education expenditure (as a share of GDP), (ii) mean years of schooling, and (iii) mean PISA test scores. At a cross-sectional level, expenditure on education correlates positively with both quantity and quality measures; and not surprisingly, the quality and quantity measures also correlate positively with each-other. But correlation does not imply causation: there are many factors that simultaneously affect education spending and outcomes. Indeed, these scatterplots show that despite the broad positive correlation, there is substantial dispersion away from the trend line &#x2013; in other words, there is substantial variation in outcomes that does not seem to be captured by differences in expenditure.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Correlation between education outcomes and education expenditure (2010 data)<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/Edu_OutcomesVsExpenditure-750x546.png" alt="Edu_OutcomesVsExpenditure" class="wp-image-8101" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/Edu_OutcomesVsExpenditure-750x546.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/Edu_OutcomesVsExpenditure-150x109.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/Edu_OutcomesVsExpenditure-400x291.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/Edu_OutcomesVsExpenditure-768x559.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/Edu_OutcomesVsExpenditure.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/06/Edu_OutcomesVsExpenditure.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="does-cross-country-variation-in-government-education-expenditure-explain-cross-country-differences-in-education-outcomes"><a class="deep-link" href="#does-cross-country-variation-in-government-education-expenditure-explain-cross-country-differences-in-education-outcomes"></a>Does cross-country variation in government education expenditure explain cross-country differences in education outcomes?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The visualization presents the relationship between PISA reading outcomes and average education spending per student, splitting the sample of countries by income levels. It shows that income is an important factor that affects both expenditure on education and education outcomes: we can see that above a certain national income level, the relationship between PISA scores and education expenditure per pupil becomes virtually inexistent. Several studies with more sophisticated econometric models corroborate the fact that expenditure on education does not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> You can read more about test scores and learning outcomes in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/quality-of-education-drop-out-rates/">Quality of Education</a>.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Average reading performance in PISA and average spending per student from the age of 6 to 15 &#x2013; Figure 1 in OECD (2012)<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/07/ourworldindata_average-reading-performance-in-pisa-and-average-spending-per-student-750x492.png" alt="Average reading performance in PISA and average spending per student" class="wp-image-5718" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/07/ourworldindata_average-reading-performance-in-pisa-and-average-spending-per-student-750x492.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/07/ourworldindata_average-reading-performance-in-pisa-and-average-spending-per-student-150x98.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/07/ourworldindata_average-reading-performance-in-pisa-and-average-spending-per-student-400x263.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/07/ourworldindata_average-reading-performance-in-pisa-and-average-spending-per-student.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/07/ourworldindata_average-reading-performance-in-pisa-and-average-spending-per-student.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="what-inputs-enter-the-education-production-function"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-inputs-enter-the-education-production-function"></a>What inputs enter the &#x2018;education production function&#x2019;?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The fact that expenditure on education does not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes is indicative of the intricate nature of the process through which such outcomes are produced.

Here we analyse available evidence of the private (i.e. individual) and social (i.e. collective) returns to education.</p><p>The most common way to measure the private returns to education, is to study how attainment improves individual labor market outcomes &#x2013; usually by attempting to measure the effect of education on wages. Regarding social returns, the most common approach is to measure the effect of education on pro-social behaviour (e.g. volunteering, political participation, interpersonal trust) and economic growth.</p><p>Most of the evidence presented below is &#x2018;descriptive&#x2019;, in the sense that it points towards correlations between education and various individuals and social outcomes, without necessarily proving <em>causation</em>. In each case, we provide a discussion of the robustness of the evidence.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="private-returns-to-education"><a class="deep-link" href="#private-returns-to-education"></a>Private returns to education</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-do-earning-correlate-with-education"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-earning-correlate-with-education"></a>How do earning correlate with education?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The OECD&#x2019;s report <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a> provides descriptive evidence of the link between individual education and income. The chart shows the earnings of tertiary-educated workers, by level of tertiary education, relative to the earnings of workers with upper secondary education. As we can see, in all OECD countries for which information is available, the higher the level of education, the greater the relative earnings.</p><p>The countries in this chart are ordered in ascending order of relative earnings. As we can see, the countries with the greatest returns to tertiary education (Brazil, Chile and Colombia) are also those where tertiary education is less prevalent among the adult population. This is indicative of the demand-and-supply dynamics that contribute to determine wage differentials across different countries.</p><p>These figures are simply correlations, and cannot be interpreted causally: individuas with more education are different in many ways to individuals with less education, so we cannot attribute wage differences solely to education choices.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Relative earnings of tertiary-educated workers, by level of tertiary education, 2013 &#x2013; Figure A6.1 in <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">OECD Education at a Glance (2015)</a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium-750x319.png" alt="OECD_SkillPremium" class="wp-image-8590" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium-750x319.png 750w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium-150x64.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium-400x170.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium-768x327.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium.png 1938w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium.png"></figure></div></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="is-there-a-causal-effect-of-education-on-earnings"><a class="deep-link" href="#is-there-a-causal-effect-of-education-on-earnings"></a>Is there a <em>causal</em> effect of education on earnings?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The previous graph gave a cross-country comparison of earning by education level. As pointed out, those figures were difficult to interpret causally, because they failed to account for important underlying differences in things like hours worked, experience profiles, etc.</p><p>The visualization, from Card (1999)<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a>, attempts to pin down the relationship between education and earnings, by comparing wages across education levels, genders and age groups. The data used for this figure comes from the March Current Population Surveys in the US. Education levels correspond to individuals with 10, 12 and 16 years of education. The marks show averages for each corresponding group, and the smooth lines show the predictions made by a simple econometric model explaining wages by education and experience.</p><p>The first conclusion from this charts is that for both genders, at any given age, individuals with more education perceive higher wages. Moreover, these estimates suggest that the incremental benefit from additional education grows with experience: the differences in wages between people with varying degrees of education become larger as they advance in their careers. In other words, education pay-offs are not constant over the life cycle. Other studies using different data have found similar results (see, for instance, Blundell et al. 2013<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a>)</p><p>These estimates can still not be interpreted causally, because there are yet other potential sources of bias that are unaccounted for, such as innate ability. To address this issue, the economics literature has developed different strategies. For example, by contrasting the wages of genetically identical twins with different schooling level, researchers have found a way of controlling for unobservable characteristics such as family background and innate ability. The conclusion from these &#x2018;twin studies&#x2019; is that the average estimates suggested by the figure, are not very different to those that would be obtained from more sophisticated models that control for ability. In other words, there is robust evidence supporting the causal effect of education on wages (for more details see Card 1999).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Hourly wage profiles for men and women &#x2013; Figure 1 in Card (1999)<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Card1999_ReturnsEducation-449x550.png" alt="Card(1999)_ReturnsEducation" class="wp-image-8592" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Card1999_ReturnsEducation-449x550.png 449w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Card1999_ReturnsEducation-122x150.png 122w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Card1999_ReturnsEducation-327x400.png 327w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Card1999_ReturnsEducation-768x941.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Card1999_ReturnsEducation.png 1484w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" data-high-res-src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2016/08/Card1999_ReturnsEducation.png"></figure></div></div></div><h3 id="social-returns-to-education"><a class="deep-link" href="#social-returns-to-education"></a>Social returns to education</h3><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="education-correlates-with-prosocial-behavior"><a class="deep-link" href="#education-correlates-with-prosocial-behavior"></a>Education correlates with prosocial behavior</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The chart uses OECD results from the Survey of Adult Skills to show how self-reported trust in others correlates with educational attainment.

This question is motivated by the notion that aggregate education (&#x2018;human capital&#x2019;) generates positive spill-over effects for everyone. A classic example of a mechanism though which education may yield such positive economic externalities, is that aggregate education improves a country&#x2019;s ability to innovate, as well as imitate and adapt new technologies, hence enabling &#x2018;technological progress&#x2019; and sustained growth (see Lindahl and Krueger (2001) for an overview of further macroeconomic theories of education and growth).<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p><p>While early studies found that schooling levels were poor predictors of economic growth, more recent studies &#x2013; that crucially made use of better data &#x2013; confirm the expected positive link. Lutz, Creso Cuaresma, and Sanderson (2008)<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a> conclude that <em>&#x201C;better education does not only lead to higher individual income, but also is a necessary (although not always sufficient) precondition for long-term economic growth.&#x201D;</em></p><p>The plot, from Hanushek and Woessmann (2010),<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a> provides a basic representation of the association between test scores and economic growth using data over the period 1960 to 2000. This type of graph, called a &#x2018;partial regression plot&#x2019;, shows the relationship between test scores and growth&#xA0;after accounting for the initial level of GDP per capita and for years of schooling in 1960. As we can see, there is a strong positive relationship. What we learn from this result is that &#x201C;test scores that are larger by 1 standard deviation (measured at the student level across all OECD countries in PISA) are associated with an average annual growth rate in GDP per capita that is two percentage points higher over the whole 40-year period.&#x201D;<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a></p><p>This coincides with other studies showing that historical increases in the number of universities across countries are positively associated with subsequent growth of GDP per capita (Valero and Van Reenen 2016).<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></p><p>A number of studies have found that it is actually education in the form of cognitive skills, rather than mere school attainment, what really matters for predicting individual earnings and economic growth.

For example, in Norway, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education reporting to trust others increases by 20 percentage points compared to someone who has upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education. Similarly, after accounting for literacy proficiency, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education increases by 16 percentage points compared to someone who has upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education.&#8221;</p></li><li id="note-23"><p>Lutz, W., Crespo Cuaresma, J., &amp; Abbasi‐Shavazi, M.
