What share thinks they are ineffective? And what share denies their importance? In this post we present the global data on attitudes to vaccination. Here is a summary of the results:
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<ul>
<li>92% of people in the world think vaccines are important for children to have;</li>
<li>7% of people globally disagree that vaccines are safe. But this differs considerably between different countries: France topped the list with 33% disagreeing;</li>
<li>Globally, 5% of people disagree that vaccines are effective. But skepticism is high in some countries, ranging from 28% in Liberia to less than 1% in Bangladesh and Egypt;</li>
<li>In many countries few people disagree that vaccines are safe and effective, but the share of people who &#x201C;neither agree nor disagree&#x201D; can be more than 50%.</li>

Only 66% of Japanese respondents thought vaccines were important for children to have &#x2013; very low in comparison to other countries. But few disagreed that vaccines were safe (only 8%) and disagreed that they&#x2019;re effective (only 3%). If few people thought they were unsafe and ineffective, why would support for vaccines be so low?</p><p>Many Japanese respondents did not answer either way. 28% answered &#x201C;neither agree nor disagree&#x201D; to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-neither-agrees-disagrees-vaccines-important">whether child vaccination is important</a>; 55% to the question regarding the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-neither-agree-disagree-vaccines-are-safe">safety of vaccines</a>; and one-third were undecided on their effectiveness. It&#x2019;s difficult here, without further questions, to fully interpret the opinions of those in this undecided category: maybe they had no opinion; or they thought vaccines could be safe or effective in some cases, but not all; or some vaccines were safe but others were not. With this data, it&#x2019;s impossible to fully understand their reasoning.</p><p>This stance was common across several other countries, as we see in the map.</p><p>While being undecided or divided is perhaps less concerning than denialism on the importance, safety and effectiveness of vaccination, it nonetheless suggests that many are unaware of the massive role vaccines have played in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#eradication-of-diseases-through-vaccination">eradicating diseases</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination#diseases-preventable-through-vaccination">saving lives across the world</a>. The success story of vaccines is one we don&#x2019;t tell often enough.</p><p>It&#x2019;s also true that people in the &#x2018;neither&#x2019; group may be more likely to be convinced by arguments that are put forward by those who deny the safety, effectiveness and importance of vaccination. In a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccine-skepticism"><strong>related post</strong></a>&#xA0;we take a look at why denialism around vaccination exists, and what is effective in addressing it.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-neither-agrees-nor-disagrees-vaccines-effective" class="grapherPreview">
